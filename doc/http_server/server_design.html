<h1>Serif HTTP Server Design</h1>

<p>The Serif HTTP server uses a multi-threaded design to ensure that
 client requests can be responded to in a timely manner, even while
 SERIF is busy processing a document.  In particular, the Serif server
 uses two threads:</p>

<ul>
  <li> The <b>Server Thread</b> is responsible for accepting and
    handling connections from clients.  It is also responsible for
    initiating connections with remote servers when necessary (e.g.,
    to download the contents of a document from a remote server).</li>
  <li> The <b>Serif Thread</b> is responsible for all interactions
    with core Serif modules.  In particular, it is responsible for
    processing documents using Serif's <code>DocumentDriver</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p> Communication between these two threads is mediated using a singleton
<a href="#SerifWorkQueue"><code>SerifWorkQueue</code></a> object.
Note that the server itself is not multithreaded -- thus, the we only
need to worry about concurrency issues such as locking when
considering the interface between the two threads (i.e., in
the <code>SerifWorkQueue</code>).</p>

<h2> The Server Thread </h2>
<div class="section">
<p>The <a href="#SerifHTTPServer"><code>SerifHTTPServer</code></a>
class is the main driver for the server thread.  This class is
responsible for listening for connections on a specified port, and
creating an <code>IncomingHTTPConnection</code> object to handle each
new connection.  All server communication is performed using
Asynchronous IO.  This means that all IO commands (including accepting
a new connection) are done by registering callbacks, which are called
when the command completes.  See the documentation for boost::asio for
more information. </p>

<p>The <code>IncomingHTTPConnection</code> class is responsible for
handling a single connection from a client.  In particular, it reads
the client's HTTP request message, performs any appropriate actions,
and sends an HTTP response message back to the client.  In some cases,
the client's request may refer to an external resource, such as a
document that is located on a remote server.  In those cases, the 
<code>IncomingHTTPConnection</code> creates one or more 
<code>OutgoingHTTPConnection</code> objects, which are responsible for
connecting to a remote server and downloading a resource.</p>

<p>Both
<code>IncomingHTTPConnection</code> and
<code>OutgoingHTTPConnection</code> share a common base class, 
<code>HTTPConnection</code>, which stores the socket object used to
communicate with the client or remote server.  In addition,
the <code>HTTPConnection</code> base class is responsible for parsing
HTTP request messages from clients and HTTP response messages from
remote server (these two message types have very similar
structures).</p>

<p>When an <code>IncomingHTTPConnection</code> needs to use Serif to
process a document, it does so by creating
a <code>ProcessDocumentTask</code>, and handing it off to the
singleton <a href="#SerifWorkQueue"><code>SerifWorkQueue</code></a>.
Each <code>ProcessDocumentTask</code> consists of an
<code>XMLSerializedDocTheory</code>, a range of processing stages that
should be run, and a pointer back to
the <code>IncomingHTTPConnection</code> that requested the task.  Once
the work queue has finished processing the document (in the Serif
Thread), it uses the server's asyncronous io handler to send a message
back to the <code>IncomingHTTPConnection</code> (in the Server
Thread), which can then respond to the client.

<p class="caption"><b>Figure 1:</b> A class diagram showing the
basic classes used by the Server Thread.  A single SerifHTTPServer
owns zero or more IncomingHTTPConnection.  Each IncomingHTTPConnection
can create zero or more OutgoingHTTPConnections (to download remote
resources); and zero or more ProcessDocumentTasks (to process
documents using the Serif DocumentDriver).</p>
</div>

<p> All code that runs in the server thread should be careful to not
directly access any core SERIF functionality, <i>including global
parameters</i>.  In general, the modules that implement the server
thread should never import any SERIF code that is outside of the
<code>SerifHTTPServer</code> project; and the ame is true for the
header files of modules implementing the serif thread. However, a few
exceptions are made for modules that are known to be safe to use from
multiple threads:</p>

<ul>
  <li> <code>Generic/common/leak_detection.h</code> </li>
  <li> <code>Generic/common/InternalInconsistencyException.h</code> </li>
  <li> <code>Generic/state/XMLStrings.h</code> </li>
  <li> <code>Generic/state/OutputUtil.h</code> (<i>except
     for <code>OutputUtil::convertToChar()</code>, which is <b>not</b>
     thread-safe.</i>)</li>
</ul>

<a name="SerifHTTPServer"/><h3><code>SerifHTTPServer</code></h3>

<p>The server thread is controlled by a
single <code>SerifHTTPServer</code> object.  When
the <code>SerifHTTPServer</code> is created, it creates a new
asyncronous IO handler (<code>boost::asio::io_service</code>) to act
as the main driver and handle all IO communications.  It then creates
an <code>IncomingHTTPConnection</code> (not connected to any client),
and tells the <code>io_service</code> to listen for connections on the
incoming port.</p>

<p>The method <code>SerifHTTPServer::run()</code> is then called,
which makes a blocking call to <code>io_service::run()</code>.  This
method will not return until the server is shut down.</p>

<p>When a client connects to the server, the <code>io_service</code>
calls <code>SerifHTTPServer::handle_accept</code>, which tells its
<code>IncomingHTTPConnection</code> to start processing the client.
The <code>SerifHTTPServer</code> also creates a
new <code>IncomingHTTPConnection</code> to be ready to process the
next client that connects.</p>

<p>Finally, the server keeps a list of weak pointers to
the <code>IncomingConnection</code>s that it has connected with
clients.  This list can be used to close all connections if the server
recieves a shut-down request.</code></p>

<a name="HTTPConnection"/><h3><code>HTTPConnection</code></h3>

<p><code>HTTPConnection</code> is an abstract base class for both 
<code>IncomingHTTPConnection</code>
and <code>OutgoingHTTPConnection</code>.  
An <code>HTTPConnection</code> object is responsible for handling
a single HTTP connection from a client (incoming) or to remote server
(outgoing).  The <code>HTTPConnection</code> class wraps a single
Boost <code>tcp::socket</code> object, which it uses to communicate with the client
or remote server.  The socket is initially closed -- it is the
responsibility of the subclass to connect it with either a client (for
incoming connections) or a remote sever (for outgoing
connections). </p>

<p><code>HTTPConnection</code> objects must always be stored
using <code>boost::shared_ptr</code>.  This lets us ensure that the
<code>HTTPConnection</code> object will still exist when any callbacks
registered with <code>io_service</code> are called (since
the <code>io_service</code> itself will have a copy of the shared
pointer to the connection).
The <code>boost::enable_shared_from_this</code> base class is used to
allow the <code>HTTPConnection</code> to get access to its own shared
pointer.</p>

<p>In addition to holding the socket associated with the conneciton,
the <code>HTTPConnection</code> base class also handles the reading
and parsing of HTTP messages (request messages for incoming
connections, and response messages for outgoing connections).  The
protected method <code>HTTPConnection::readMessage()</code> starts
reading the message (asynchronously), and will call the abstract
virtual method <code>HTTPConnection::handleMessage()</code> when the
message has been read and parsed.  If any error occurs while reading
or parsing the message, it will
call <code>HTTPConnection::handleReadErrorMessge</code> instead. </p>

<a name="IncomingHTTPConnection"/><h3><code>IncomingHTTPConnection</code></h3>

<p>Each <code>IncomingHTTPConnection</code> object is responsible for
handling a single HTTP connection from a client.  It is created by
the <code>SerifHTTPServer</code>, which will
call <code>IncomingHTTPConnection::start()</code> once a client
connects.  It then reads the request message (using the base class
method <code>HTTPConnection::readMessage()</code>), and responds
as appropriate to the given request:

<div class="indented">
  <p><b><code>POST SerifXMLRequest</code></b>: Process the given
    XML-formatted request message.  The contents of the request should
    be a single <code>&lt;SerifXMLRequest&gt;</code> document,
    containing a single command element.  (In the future, we may
    support <code>&lt;SerifXMLRequest&gt;</code>s that contain
    multiple commands).  Currently, a single command is defined:</p>

  <div class="indented">
    <p><b><code>&lt;ProcessDocument&gt;</code></b>: Use SERIF to process a
      document, whose contents can be specified either inline or using
      an <code>href</code> to an external URL.  Currently, the server
      supports file URLs (<code>file://<i>abspath</i></code>) and HTTP
      URLs (<code>http://<i>server</i>/<i>path</i></code>).  In the
      future, we might add support for other URL types (e.g.  to read
      documents from a cloud data source).</p>
  </div>
  
  <p>If the <code>IncomingHTTPConnection</code> needs to download one
  or more files before it can fulfill the request (e.g., to get the
  contents of a document from a remote source), then it creates one or
  more <code>OutgoingHTTPConnection</code>s to download those
  resources.  The <code>IncomingHTTPConnection</code> keeps a list of
  all active outgoing connections.  When each outgoing connection is
  completed, it is removed from this list.  Once there are no more
  outgoing connections, the <code>IncomingHTTPConnection</code>
  proceeds to perform the requested task.</p>

  <p>In order to perform the <code>&lt;ProcessDocument&gt;</code>
  task, the <code>IncomingHTTPConnection</code> creates
  a <code>ProcessDocumentTask</code> object, which stores a document
  to process along with a range of SERIF stages that should be run.
  This task object is then added to the
  singleton <code>SerifWorkQueue</code>, using the thread-safe
  method <code>SerifWorkQueue::addTask()</code>.  Once the work queue
  performs the task (in the Serif Thread), it will send back a
  response via
  the <code>SerifHTTPServer</code>'s <code>io_service</code>.  When
  the <code>IncomingHTTPConnection</code> receives this response from
  the serif thread, it relays it back to the client, and finally
  closes the connection.</p>
</div>

<div class="indented">
  <p><b><code>POST sgm2apf</code></b>: Process the given SGM document
  from start to finish, and return the resulting APF file.  The
  contents of the request document should be the SGM document itself.
  This is a convenience method that makes it simpler to run the system
  end-to-end and get back an APF annotation file, without having to
  wrap the document in any way.  The <code>POST sgm2apf</code> request
  is handled similarly to how the <code>&lt;ProcessDocument&gt;</code>
  XML command is handled.</p>
</div>

<div class="indented">
  <p><b><code>GET <i>path</i></code></b>: If the server documentation
  root directory parameter (<code>server_docs_root</code>) is defined,
  then append the given path to the root
  directory <code>server_docs_root</code>, and if the resulting path
  corresponds with a file, then return the contents of that file.
  This allows the Serif HTTP server to be self-documenting.</p>
</div>

<a name="OutgoingHTTPConnection"/><h3><code>OutgoingHTTPConnection</code></h3>

<p>The <code>OutgoingHTTPConnection</code> class is responsible for
sending a message to a remote server, and returning the response.  Its
constructor takes a server, an HTTP request message that should be
sent to that server, and
a <code>OutgoingHTTPConnection::ResponseHandler</code> object
containing two callbacks: one to handle the response from a successful
connection, and the other to handle an error message.  Currently, if
the remote server responds with any status code other
than <code>200</code> (<code>OK</code>), then
the <code>OutgoingHTTPConnection</code> will treat it as an error.  In
particular, redirections (status code 3xx) are not supported.</p>

</div> <!-- The Server Thread -->

<h2> The Serif Thread </h2>
<div class="section">

<p>The Serif Thread is responsible for performing all tasks that use
SERIF's core code.  It is necessary to run all Serif-dependant tasks
in a single thread, because Serif's code base is not thread-safe.
This is why it is important that the Server Thread never perform any
Serif-related tasks -- they might interfere with operations performed
by the Serif Thread.</p>

<a name="SerifWorkQueue"/><h3><code>SerifWorkQueue</code></h3>

<p>The <code>SerifWorkQueue</code>
class is the main driver for the serif thread.  It is a singleton
class -- i.e., it has a single instance, which is created the first
time <code>SerifWorkQueue::getSingletonWorkQueue()</code> is called.
Subsequent calls
to <code>SerifWorkQueue::getSingletonWorkQueue()</code> return that
same instance. </p>

<p> The <code>SerifWorkQueue</code> contains a list
of <code>SerifWorkQueue::Task</code> objects, each encoding a single
task that should be performed using Serif.  New tasks can be added to
the queue using <code>SerifWorkQueue::addTask</code>; and tasks can be
popped off the queue using <code>SerifWorkQueue::getNextTask()</code>.
Both of these methods (as well as all of <code>SerifWorkQueue</code>'s
public methods) are thread-safe.

<p> The <code>SerifWorkQueue</code> also owns a
single <code>DocumentDriver</code>, which it uses to run Serif.  The
reason that it uses a single <code>DocumentDriver</code> (rather than
creating a new one for each task that needs one) is that this allows
it to avoid reloading Serif's modules each time it needs to perform
some task.</p>

<p> The <code>SerifWorkQueue</code> starts a new thread as soon as it
is created, running the method <code>SerifWorkQueue::run()</code>.
This method simply waits for a task to be added to the queue, and then
runs it.  It runs a single task at a time.  The <code>run()</code>
method never returns. </p>

<p> <code>SerifWorkQueue</code> ensures thread-safety using a single
<code>boost::mutex</code>, which is locked inside all critical
sections.  Any public method should be considered a critical section. </p>

<a name="SerifWorkQueue"/><h3><code>SerifWorkQueue::Task</code></h3>

<p> The abstract base class <code>SerifWorkQueue::Task</code> is used
to define the interface for tasks.  Each <code>Task</code> object
defines a <code>run()</code> method, which takes a pointer to the
singleton <code>SerifWorkQueue</code>'s <code>DocumentDriver</code>,
and does whatever work it needs to do.  When it is done, it can
respond to the client using the protected
methods <code>Task::sendResponse()</code>
and <code>Task::reportError</code>.  Both of these methods use the
Server Thread's <code>io_service</code> to send a message to
the <code>IncomingHTTPConnection</code> that created
the <code>Task</code>. </p>

<a name="SerifWorkQueue"/><h3><code>ProcessDocumentTask</code></h3>

<p> <code>ProcessDocumentTask</code> is the <code>Task</code> class
used to handle <code>&lt;ProcessDocument&gt;</code> requests from the
client.  Its <code>run()</code> method deserializes the incoming
document, uses the <code>DocumentDriver</code> to process the
document, and sends the result back to the
client.  <code>ProcessDocumentTask</code> uses a set of options, which
are read from the &lt;ProcessDocument&gt; element, to determine
exactly what stages it should run and how it should serialize the
result.</p>

<h2> Control Flow Example </h2>
<div class="section">

<p> The following diagram gives an example of how control flows during
a typical run of the server.  The Server Thread is shown in green, and
the Serif Thread is shown in red.

<div class="figure">
<div class="figure-image">
<img src="server_control_flow_example.png"/>
</div>
<p class="caption"><b>Figure 2:</b> Control Flow Example.  The green
line shows the control flow for the Server Thread; and the red line
shows the control flow for the Serif Thread.  Once the 
<code>SerifHTTPServer</code> has created an <code>io_service</code>
and an initial (unconnected) <code>IncomingHTTPConnection</code>, it
lets the <code>io_service</code> know that it should accept
connections on the <code>IncomingHTTPConnection</code>'s socket (with
the call to <code>async_accept()</code>).  It then hands control over
to the <code>io_service</code> object (with the call
to <code>run()</code>).  Once a client connects,
the <code>io_service</code> calls the
server's <code>handleAccept()</code> method, which lets
the <code>IncomingHTTPConnection</code> know it should start
processing.  The <code>IncomingHTTPConnection</code> lets
the <code>io_service</code> know it wants to read from the socket, and
then returns.  Once the client writes their request message,
the <code>ioservice</code> calls
the <code>IncomingHTTPConnection</code>'s <code>handleRead()</code>
method.  (<code>handleRead()</code> will be called repeatedly until
the entire request message is delivered.)  Once the request is
available, the <code>IncomingHTTPConnection</code> uses it to create
an appropriate <code>ProcessDocumentTask</code> object.  It hands this
object over to the <code>SerifWorkQueue</code>
(using <code>addTask()</code>), and returns back to
the <code>io_service</code>.  (Note that the <code>io_service</code>
can process additional incoming connections while the Serif Thread
works on the task.)  Once the task is complete, it makes a call
to <code>io_service::post()</code>, containing the response message.
The <code>io_service</code> then relays that message back to the
originating <code>IncomingHTTPConnection</code>, which uses
asyncronous calls to send a response back to the client.  Once
the <code>io_service</code> has finished sending the response from
the <code>IncomingHTTPConnection</code>, it
calls <code>IncomingHTTPConnection::handleWrite()</code>, which closes the connection and returns.</p>
