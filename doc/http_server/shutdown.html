<h1>Shutting Down & Restarting the Serif Server</h1>

<p> The SerifHTTP server defines four POST commands that can be used
to shut down or restart the server: </p>

<table>
<tr><th align="left" valign="top">
  <code>POST&nbsp;Shutdown</code></th>
  <td>Shut down the server.  The server will stop accepting
  connections, but will finish processing any client connections that
  are currently active. </th></tr>
<tr><th align="left" valign="top">
  <code>POST&nbsp;ImmediateShutdown</code></th>
  <td>Shut down the server immediately.  The server will stop
  accepting connections, and will close any client connections that
  are currently active. </th></tr>
<tr><th align="left" valign="top">
  <code>POST&nbsp;Restart</code></th>
  <td>Restart the server.  The server will stop accepting connections,
  and finish processing any client connections that are currently
  active.  Once all active connections have been processed, the server
  will restart (using the same command-line arguments that it was
  originally run with).  If the configuration file has changed, then
  it will be reloaded. </th></tr>
<tr><th align="left" valign="top">
  <code>POST&nbsp;ImmediateRestart</code></th>
  <td>Restart the server immediately The server will stop accepting
  connections, and close any client connections that are currently
  active.  It will then restart (using the same command-line arguments
  that it was originally run with).  If the configuration file has
  changed, then it will be reloaded. </th></tr>
</table>


<p> The following example illustrates the use of these commands.
(Note that, per the HTTP specification, the request message must be
terminated by a blank line.) </p>
