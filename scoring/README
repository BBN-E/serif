======================== SCORING SCRIPT WRAPPERS =========================

These scripts provide a simple interface to the ACE scoring scripts
and the APF view scripts.  They are called directly by SERIF during
the 'score' stage.  The script that SERIF calls is controlled by the
'+score_script+' variable.  The version of Perl used to run the script
is controlled by the '+perl_binary+' variable.

  ace-all-do-quick-score-v01.pl
    Script that runs all three ace scoring scripts (ace05, ace07, and ace08)
    to compare the output of a regression test experiment with a reference
    output directory.
  
  ace05-do-quick-score-v14.pl
    Script that runs the ace05 scoring script to compare the output of a
    regression test experiment with a reference output directory.
  
  ace07-do-quick-score-v01.pl
    Script that runs the ace07 scoring script to compare the output of a
    regression test experiment with a reference output directory.
  
  ace07-do-score-v01.pl
    Script that runs the ace07 scoring script to compare the output of a
    regression test experiment with a reference output directory.  In 
    addition to generating the basic score file output, this script also
    generates APF views, using the apf5cmp*.pl scripts.

======================= SCORE EXTRACTION SCRIPTS =========================

These scripts extract basic score information from the output that is 
generated by the ACE score scripts, and write it to a new file.

  get-ace2005-scores.pl, get-ace2007-scores.pl, get-ace2008-scores.pl
    Extract a single entity score, relation score, and event score 
    from the score output files that were generated by the ACE score
    scripts.  All three of these files generate output in the same
    format.

  get-ace2005-scores-ment.pl
    Extract mention score information from the scoring output of the 
    ace05-eval.pl script.

  get-ace2007-timex2-scores.pl
    Extract timex2 score information from the scoring output of the 
    ace07-eval.pl script.

  get-ace2007-values-scores.pl
    Extract value score information from the scoring output of the 
    ace07-eval.pl script.

========================== ACE SCORING SCRIPTS ===========================

These are the standard ACE scoring scripts provided by NIST.  Their
official home is:

    <http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/tests/ace/2005/software.html>
    <http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/tests/ace/2007/software.html>
    <http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/tests/ace/2008/software.html>

We are currently using the following versions (n.b.: in some cases, these
are *not* the latest version available -- should they be updated?):
  
  ace05-eval-v14.pl  --  The standard ACE-05 scoring script
  ace07-eval-v01.pl  --  The standard ACE-07 scoring script
  ace08-eval-v08.pl  --  The standard ACE-08 scoring script

============================= APF VIEW SCRIPTS ===========================

  apf5cmp.pl, apf5cmp-event-highlight.pl
    These scripts are used to generate HTML output that shows a comparison
    of the regression test output with the reference output.  They are
    usually called via ace07-do-score-v01.pl
