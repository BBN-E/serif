He leads his flock upstairs -- to a theater like no other . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Schmidt</ENAMEX> 's play , called `` The Last Supper , '' is a highly unorthodox bit of dinner theater -- presented in the actor-playwright 's own <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> apartment . 

This quiet neighborhood is about as far `` off Broadway '' as it gets . 

On a weekend evening , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmidt</ENAMEX> leads a group of strangers -- a biologist , a <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">City Hall</ENAMEX> lawyer , an actress , a literary agent -- into his cramped kitchen-living room . 

The visitors amble past a child 's red wagon and a coffee table adorned with a doll . 

Call them props for the unscripted moments when his kids , 6-year -old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack</ENAMEX> and 3-year -old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beatrice</ENAMEX> , will dart by during the monologue or call out , `` Daddy ! '' 

The visitors settle into their seats -- old church pews -- for the retelling of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> ' last meal , with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmidt</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> and his spectators representing the disciples . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmidt</ENAMEX> calls it `` an evening of honest-to- God '' theater -- served up with a side of reality . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmidt</ENAMEX> 's wife , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Beth Kilkelly</ENAMEX> , a former actress who markets children 's books , helps with the cleaning and even handles calls for reservations . 

`` It 's been terrific because the play is really great , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kilkelly</ENAMEX> , who joins the spectators midway through dinner to chat . 

`` It 's very enjoyable to talk to people and see what they think . '' 

Curiosity -seekers from around the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> , as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Argentina</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> have called for tickets to the performances that are sold out through March 1 . 

One evening , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> `` Today '' show crew descended on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmidt</ENAMEX> home , crisscrossing the tiny kitchen with cables and cameras . 

It 's show time . 

`` Please rise and turn to Hymn 47 , '' instructs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmidt</ENAMEX> , a 40-year -old native of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chapel Hill</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX> . 

Before the visitors break bread on a plywood table , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesus</ENAMEX> character , in a gray T -shirt , delivers the Biblical story of multiplying bread and fish to feed the multitudes . 

`` You either believe , or you do n't ,'' he intones in the drawl of a Southern preacher , thumping the Bible . 

`` This book is filled with stories even more outlandish . '' 

In his own outlandish style -- but with what he considers due respect to his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic</ENAMEX> heritage -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmidt</ENAMEX> bounces existential curve balls around the apartment , where angst-ridden lives are questioned , mocked and rhapsodized . 

He pokes the human psyche , digressing into everything from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greek</ENAMEX> tragedy to twists on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Agatha Christie</ENAMEX> . 

Somehow , four Biblical characters morph into a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> mobster named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Judas</ENAMEX> , an older woman wearing a tattered hat , a middle-age homemaker and her pregnant teenage daughter . 

And somehow , this take on the New Testament , set in the urban jungle , comes complete with a murder mystery . 

`` It 's about what we believe , why we believe , how we believe , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmidt</ENAMEX> says of his play . 

He claims he 's an ordained minister , thanks to a $ 14 Internet license . 

But he also keeps repeating that it 's all an act , that he 's `` just pretending . '' 

One element is very real -- the food : gourmet cheese appetizers , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgian</ENAMEX> beer , home-cooked lamb stew , three bottles of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cotes du Rhone</ENAMEX> wine beneath a wrought-iron chandelier , alight with candles . 

Each dish of homemade ice cream is topped with a dark chocolate cross . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmidt</ENAMEX> creates the crosses each week , pouring bittersweet <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgian</ENAMEX> chocolate into a mold with a baby spoon . 

The `` suggested donation '' for this cross-pollination of `` Saturday Night Live '' and soul-wrenching religion is $ 25 to $ 40 per person , stuffed into an `` offering '' envelop inside one of the dozen hymnals at the pews . 

This is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmidt</ENAMEX> 's big break after years of `` temp '' jobs , with only a few small productions amid countless rejection letters -- duly quoted in the evening 's program . 

`` I was very moved by the idea of a guy dedicating his life to working in his study , creating characters , '' said spectator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ethan McSweeny</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brooklyn</ENAMEX> artist . 

`` It 's an act of faith -- that you will one day affect somebody . '' 

The play 's run ends in March , after more than 10 months of theater in the home of a family that admittedly sometimes craves the return of `` normalcy . '' 

Concedes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmidt</ENAMEX> : `` We do n't want pews in our kitchen forever . '' 

Waiting list reservations can be made by calling 718-499-7758 . 

___ On the Net : `` The Last Supper '' : http : //www.nytheatre.com/nytheatre/lastsupp.htm 

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">American</ENAMEX> troop reinforcements come to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX> daily in the biggest military buildup in the region since the Gulf War -- but it 's hard to tell . 

After heavy media coverage of their departure from bases in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> this week , the soldiers are landing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX> in near secrecy . 

The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> government is engaged in a juggling act -- advertising loudly to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> that he faces the threat of massive force if he fails to give up weapons of mass destruction , while trying to keep a low profile in the gulf region to ease local sensitivities . 

The balance is highly visible -- or perhaps invisible -- in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX> , the largest forward staging area for a potential <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> ground invasion of southern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> . 

Troops from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">3rd Infantry Division</ENAMEX> , based at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Fort Stewart</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX> , this week have been arriving at a military base near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait City</ENAMEX> 's international airport , part of a deployment that will ultimately bring the division 's entire 17,000 troops to the region . 

Reporters have been forbidden from entering the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwaiti</ENAMEX> base to film or interview the arriving troops . 

Convoys of buses guarded by machine gun-equipped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Humvees</ENAMEX> and police cars shepherd the Americans to their camps , which are generally closed to the media . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> military spokesmen have confirmed the arrivals are taking place , but will not discuss numbers or units . 

`` We 're not discussing force flows , '' said Capt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Connolly</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> public affairs officer . 

`` We 're telling people we 're redeploying forces around the world to support the war on terrorism , and that 's it . '' 

The military worries the deployment -- involving tens of thousands of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">American</ENAMEX> soldiers and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. marines</ENAMEX> , as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Navy</ENAMEX> battle groups and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Air Force</ENAMEX> units around the region -- might be seen as indicating an invasion is imminent . 

That decision , officials stress , lies with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> and the buildup is only to give him forces at his disposal if he judges military action must be used to rid <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> of weapons of mass destruction . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX> was uncomfortable when journalists covering the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> 's biggest live-fire exercise since the Gulf War reported comments and took pictures of troops stating their readiness for war -- such as a tank with a cannon painted with the words , `` All The Way to Baghdad . '' 

Since then , public affairs officers have asked reporters -- and told the soldiers -- to focus on the celebrations , not war speculation . 

At the same time , in reaction to criticism over reporters ' lack of access to the 1991 Gulf War , the military is trying to allow more opportunities for coverage . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX> owes its freedom from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraqi</ENAMEX> occupation to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> -led coalition that drove out <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> 's military in 1991 . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ayed al- Mannah</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwaiti</ENAMEX> political analyst , said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">American</ENAMEX> buildup does embarrass <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX> , `` but the justification is clear : We have no other choice but to support the Americans . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> did n't leave us any other choice . '' 

He noted that there is a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> military buildup in other countries , but believes the media are concentrating on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX> because it borders <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> . 

`` Some believe that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX> wants revenge , but this is not correct , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al- Mannah</ENAMEX> said . 

`` There is a sort of unjustified dense media coverage . 

The war has n't even started . '' 

Around the region , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> military personnel try to keep a low profile to accommodate local sensitivities , and troops seldom wear uniforms off base . 

The real-life love between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brittany Murphy</ENAMEX> and her `` Just Married '' co-star <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ashton Kutcher</ENAMEX> began with a squabble . 

The clash evolved into a crush between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murphy</ENAMEX> , who played <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eminem</ENAMEX> 's girlfriend in `` 8 Mile , '' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kutcher</ENAMEX> , best known as blockheaded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelso</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX> broadcasting network sitcom `` That ' 70s Show . '' 

`` We got into an argument during the first rehearsal and I 've never argued with anyone in rehearsal before in my whole life , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murphy</ENAMEX> gushed during an interview at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX> studios after an appearance on `` The Tonight Show . '' 

Wearing jeans , stiletto heels , and a black blazer over a white tank-top , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murphy</ENAMEX> laughs loud and easily , dismissing the long-ago disagreement as `` just a bicker . 

I do n't even remember why , it was that silly . '' 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kutcher</ENAMEX> , interviewed later , tells it like this : `` We had this big blowout fight . 

She hated me . 

I hated her . 

It was a straight-up argument . 

But we both apologized to each other later . '' 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murphy</ENAMEX> said sharing most of the movie as a honeymooning couple who ca n't stop arguing helped them become `` buddies '' -- but nothing more , at first . 

`` I had a broken heart when we first met and he was in a very serious relationship with a lovely young woman , but we just clicked and had a great time filming , '' the 25-year -old actress said . 

`` Then I went away to do a film , he went away to do a film and it was about -LRB- two months ago -RRB- when we looked at each other and thought , ` OK , this is something ... ' '' 

Since then , the couple has appeared together in a tangolike dance sequence last month at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VH1</ENAMEX> cable TV 's `` Big in 2002 Awards '' and recently co-hosted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTV</ENAMEX> cable TV 's New Year 's Eve `` Pajama Party '' from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Times Square</ENAMEX> . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murphy</ENAMEX> said she is n't worried about the public attention affecting their romance . 

`` Just because people are paying more attention , I do n't think you should change your behavior because that perhaps could put a larger strain on the relationship , '' she said . 

The petite blond actress , known for her pouty lips , squeaky-scratchy voice and wide eyes sometimes ringed by dark circles , has seen her popularity soar since the blockbuster debut of `` 8 Mile . '' 

`` That changed a lot , '' she said . 

`` That was the difference between people knowing my first and last name as opposed to not . '' 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murphy</ENAMEX> has completed work on two other films , playing a drug-addicted stripper in `` Spun '' and a kindly nanny in `` Molly Gunn , '' and hopes her budding popularity will help jump-start a few personal projects , such as a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janis Joplin</ENAMEX> biopic she was hired to star in before the project fell apart over music rights . 

Meanwhile , she plans to take time off from film work to develop a singing career -- although she wo n't say what kind of music . 

`` It 'll be a surprise , '' she said . 

Despite rumors she and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eminem</ENAMEX> dated while filming `` 8 Mile , '' she has described him as a close friend whose privacy she tries to respect . 

`` During our first day of hair and makeup for a screen test in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX> , there was a book about him on the counter and I opened it up and then closed it and decided not to read it , '' she said . 

`` I realized , ` OK , if there is anything in his life he wants to tell me , he 'll tell me as I get to know him . ' '' 

`` Just Married '' gives <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murphy</ENAMEX> a chance to play a lighter role , akin to her breakthrough performance as the makeover project in `` Clueless '' and her vocal work as quavery-voiced cousin <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luanne Platter</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX> cartoon sitcom `` King of the Hill . '' 

In recent years , she has co-starred as a suicidal woman obsessed with cooked chicken in `` Girl , Interrupted , '' and played a wannabe model eager to escape the streets of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX> in `` 8 Mile , '' while the thriller `` Do n't Say a Word '' featured her as a secretive , near-catatonic abuse victim . 

`` I was never trained in acting , never trained in singing , only dance , '' she said , adding that most of her performances are instinctive . 

`` The characters basically take over me and use my emotions where they need to , if that makes any sense . '' 

Born in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murphy</ENAMEX> was raised there for two years by her single mother before they moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Edison</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> , to live closer to family . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sharon Murphy</ENAMEX> worked as a saleswoman to support her daughter and encouraged her fascination with performing . 

As a youngster , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murphy</ENAMEX> said she fantasized about making movies with her dolls or being a cast member on `` Saturday Night Live . '' 

After appearing in school and local theater productions , she began to audition for commercials . 

Ads for candy , pizza restaurants and board games led her to move to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> , where she played small roles on short-lived sitcoms before her breakthrough in 1995 's `` Clueless . '' 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murphy</ENAMEX> credits her mother 's support for her career success . 

`` When I asked my mom to move to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> , she sold everything and moved out here for me , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murphy</ENAMEX> said . 

`` I was really grateful to have grown up in an environment that was conducive to creating and did n't stifle any of that . 

She always believed in me . '' 

In a yurt on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Fork</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">American River</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gold Country</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack Bibbo</ENAMEX> huddled against the 28 F -LRB- 2 below zero C -RRB- weather . 

This was a culmination of what had started out as a joke . 

The only energy he had -- 345 watts in eight batteries -- came from the sun and was n't for luxuries like heat . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bibbo</ENAMEX> needed all that power to edit about 50 hours of documentary film to under two hours . 

Now the film , edited using only solar power , is finished , and the story of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eustace Conway</ENAMEX> , a man who left his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX> home at 17 to live in the woods and decided to stay , is ready to be shown . 

It took <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bibbo</ENAMEX> nine months to get `` Full Circle '' ready for the public . 

`` I jokingly said , ` what if I were to edit this film with the use of solar power ? ' 

It was October of 2000 , and it was around the time when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> was having the energy crisis , '' he said . 

`` After I threw it out there , it grew legs of its own , '' he said , and what started as a joke became an earnest pursuit . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bibbo</ENAMEX> , who had previously spent four years making snowboarding films , knew nothing about how to use solar power to edit his movie . 

He started collecting information and took classes at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Solar Living Institute</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hopland</ENAMEX> , an organization that teaches people how to live in an environmentally sustainable way . 

Then , when he thought he knew enough , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bibbo</ENAMEX> began work . 

It was July 2001 . 

He started in a two-room tent on a 16-acre -LRB- 6.4-hectare -RRB- parcel that a man let him use for free . 

He had two solar panels and four batteries and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Apple</ENAMEX> G4 computer . 

He told his landlord he 'd be there for two months . 

Four months later , he still had no film cut . 

But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bibbo</ENAMEX> kept plugging away . 

He exchanged his two-room tent for a 14-by-14-foot -LRB- 4.3-by-4.3-meter -RRB- yurt -LRB- a portable canvas-walled home -RRB- , added two solar panels and four batteries , and switched to a laptop that used one-tenth of the energy that his G4 did . 

Every four or five days , he would recharge his solar batteries and drive into town where he would get supplies , use library computers to e-mail people , and get cell-phone reception . 

Temperatures in the yurt rose as high as 110 degrees in the summer and as low as 28 degrees in the winter . 

Why go through all that just to edit a movie ? 

`` I wanted to stay within the environmental message of the film , '' he said . 

`` I 'm asking the people in the audience to question themselves , and I had to question myself as well . '' 

And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bibbo</ENAMEX> 's challenges lasted only nine months . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conway</ENAMEX> , the subject of the movie , has been living out in the woods , bathing in icy rivers , trapping and growing his own food for 17 years . 

He also runs a preserve where he teaches others about his way of life . 

Conway also embarks on the occasional adventure , such as canoeing down the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mississippi River</ENAMEX> or riding a horse across the country . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bibbo</ENAMEX> went with him on part of a 2,500-mile -LRB- 4,000-kilometer -RRB- circle around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Great Plains</ENAMEX> in a horse and buggy with his friends , and visited <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conway</ENAMEX> at his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Carolina</ENAMEX> preserve three times to make his film . 

`` It 's quite an honor that he 'd do the story and go about it in a solar-powered way , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Conway</ENAMEX> said . 

`` It represents a lot of what I 'm talking about and teaching ... he got that message . '' 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bibbo</ENAMEX> is shopping the movie to film festivals and is planning a `` solar tour '' in the spring , to places , like a forest , where there 's no electricity . 

He 'll project the movie using solar power . 

`` I loved the solitude , '' he said of his editing experience . 

`` I went through a lot of really good personal growth about being alone , challenging myself , overcoming the fear of not really knowing what you 're doing and then doing it . 

I left the river really empowered . '' 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman Hollyn</ENAMEX> , who teaches editing at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Southern California</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">School of Cinema - Television</ENAMEX> , said editing a film by solar power is a novel idea -- and not a bad one . 

`` You develop such a close relationship to the material that you have to really like the people and the material you 're working with , '' he said . 

`` You have to want to spend nine months working with them . ''

A substance in the saliva of vampire bats could prove to be a potent new treatment for strokes , an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australian</ENAMEX> scientist says . 

`` When the vampire bat bites its victim , it secretes this powerful clot-dissolving substance so that the victim 's blood will keep flowing , allowing the bat to feed , '' said Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Medcalf</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monash University Department of Medicine</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Box Hill Hospital</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Victoria</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> . 

That same substance -- Desmodus rotundus salivary plasminogen activator , or DSPA -- might someday be given to stroke victims to dissolve clots and thereby limit brain damage , he said . 

The substance has yet to be tested for effectiveness and safety in humans , but it showed promise in preliminary experiments in mice . 

The findings were reported in Thursday 's issue of the journal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stroke</ENAMEX> , published by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Heart Association</ENAMEX> . 

The research involves ischemic strokes , which are the most common kind of stroke and occur when a blood clot or narrowing of blood vessels prevents blood from getting to the brain . 

The other type of stroke is a hemorrhagic stroke , which occurs when a blood vessel bursts and causes bleeding in the brain . 

Some ischemic stroke victims are given a clot-busting substance called tissue plasminogen activator , or TPA . 

But one major drawback of TPA is that it must be administered within three hours of the stroke 's onset , or else the drug itself can cause bleeding and brain damage . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Medcalf</ENAMEX> 's research team injected DSPA and TPA in mice and watched for brain damage . 

Mice that got DSPA suffered less brain damage . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Medcalf</ENAMEX> said that DSPA is not only a more potent clot-buster but can also be safely administered up to nine hours after the stroke 's onset because it more precisely targets blood clots , which are held together by a string-like substance called fibrin . 

`` DSPA is almost inactive in the absence of fibrin and therefore much more fibrin-specific than TPA , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Medcalf</ENAMEX> said . 

One expert warned that the research was limited to mice that had not suffered strokes . 

`` This is several factors removed from a necessarily meaningful clinical effect , '' said Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Goldstein</ENAMEX> , director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duke University</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center for Cerebrovascular Disease</ENAMEX> and chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Stroke Association Advisory Committee</ENAMEX> . 

`` Does this have potential ? 

Yes . 

But whether it will prove to be safe or efficacious for humans with strokes , that 's a whole different story . '' 

And Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keith A. Siller</ENAMEX> , an assistant professor of neurology at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYU School of Medicine</ENAMEX> , said that the nine-hour window is not necessarily an advantage . 

He said that any drug administered after three hours is essentially pointless because the damage to the brain has already been done . 

Director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang Jiandong</ENAMEX> knew he was challenging <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chinese</ENAMEX> sensibilities with a television series focusing on domestic violence . 

What he did n't count on was it becoming a commercial -- and emotional -- triumph . 

Viewers , including some victims of abuse , are praising the realism and gutsiness of `` Do n't Talk to Strangers , '' a 23-part series that ran on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chinese</ENAMEX> networks and is being marketed abroad . 

Women 's groups have hailed it as an eye-opener for a society just coming to grips with spousal abuse . 

`` This is really a sign of progress for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chinese</ENAMEX> society , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang</ENAMEX> says . 

`` Do n't Talk to Strangers '' has been credited with bringing the uncomfortable subject into the open in an unprecedented way for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , where traditional culture teaches that family problems should stay within the family . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang</ENAMEX> , who co-wrote the series , says he did n't expect the response the show got , though he acknowledges he wanted to shake up viewers . 

That began with the backgrounds of the main characters . 

Instead of an uneducated farmer or drunken factory worker -- the typical profiles of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chinese</ENAMEX> wife beaters -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang</ENAMEX> made his villain a suave , respected doctor living an upper-middle-class lifestyle in the booming eastern port city of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xiamen</ENAMEX> . 

The jarring effect is magnified by the scary realism of the beatings on the show , as Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">An Jiahe</ENAMEX> -LRB- played by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feng Yuanzheng</ENAMEX> -RRB- leaves his frail schoolteacher wife bloody and bruised after repeatedly striking her in a jealous rage . 

`` It 's sad , but a lot of families are like that , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang</ENAMEX> says . 

`` You have to be realistic to make an impact . '' 

Though the production seems stilted , `` Do n't Talk to Strangers '' stands out amid <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chinese</ENAMEX> television 's usual offerings of mawkish family drama and heroic portrayals of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party</ENAMEX> officials , police and other social models . 

To <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang</ENAMEX> 's surprise , his show made it past <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party</ENAMEX> propaganda officials who generally frown on negative portrayals of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chinese</ENAMEX> society -- something the director attributes to a new willingness among leaders to confront social problems . 

Officials have begun to address AIDS , drugs and suicide , all topics formerly hidden . 

Not everyone was a fan , though . 

Some viewers and officials found the show too violent , too gloomy , too hopeless . 

`` There were a lot of people who said the topic was n't appropriate for television . 

Some said it left them depressed for days , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang</ENAMEX> said . 

But there were testimonials , too . 

A meteorologist who had been beaten by her spouse identified with the show 's battered wife , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mei Xiaonan</ENAMEX> -LRB- played by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mei Ting</ENAMEX> -RRB- . 

The show convinced her that leaving her husband was the right decision , the woman wrote to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang</ENAMEX> . 

Activists say spousal abuse occurs in one in three <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chinese</ENAMEX> families , slightly higher than the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> average of one in four . 

In modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , women suffer from low political representation and strict family planning policies that reinforce the traditional preference for boys . 

When spousal abuse occurs , police often recommend only mediation . 

That has started to change during the last three years , at least on paper . 

The marriage law of 2001 gives victims the right to official protection and orders abusers punished . 

In divorce cases , victims of abuse can also sue for damages . 

Yet willingness to enforce the law varies widely across the country , and the resources to help abused women are scarce . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's first battered women 's shelters opened recently in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hubei</ENAMEX> province , but were forced to close because of lack of money or authorities ' unwillingness to offer protection . 

`` It 's not across the country , but there is a trend in evidence of police and courts being more sensitive , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Lanyan</ENAMEX> , an adviser for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N. Development Fund for Women</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> . 

She warns , though , that without government backing , individual efforts by women to provide shelter and support will fail . 

The government-affiliated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">All China Federation of Women</ENAMEX> is pushing for more specific legal definitions of abuse to help prosecutions . 

But it 's also working to help women recognize that psychological abuse and casual slaps are unacceptable too , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhao Shuhua</ENAMEX> , director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> branch 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Women 's Rights and Interests Protection Division</ENAMEX> . 

`` There 's a saying that it 's normal for couples to fight , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhao</ENAMEX> says , `` and it 's hard to get people to see that as violence . '' 

A federal task force created after the 2001 terrorist attacks to track down and paralyze the finances of groups that bankroll terrorism will nearly double in size to stay on top of an ever-changing money trail . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operation Green Quest</ENAMEX> , a multi-agency task force led by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Customs Service</ENAMEX> , will expand over the next couple months from about 240 agents and analysts to roughly 460 , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX> Commissioner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Bonner</ENAMEX> said in an interview Thursday with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Associated Press</ENAMEX> . 

As terrorist financiers are forced out of the traditional banking system , they are turning to riskier ways to move money , including smuggling cash and cigarettes ; trafficking of diamonds , gold and drugs ; and siphoning money from charitable donations , law enforcement officials say . 

`` The bottom line is to be even more effective in staunching the flow of funds to international terrorists organizations like the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al- Qaida</ENAMEX> , depriving them of the financial wherewithal to mount and stage major terrorist attacks against the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">American</ENAMEX> people and frankly elsewhere in the world , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonner</ENAMEX> said in the interview . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operation Green Quest</ENAMEX> was set up Oct. 25 , 2001 following the terror attacks in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> . 

The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> identified <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Osama bin Laden</ENAMEX> as the prime suspect and went about mobilizing resources to cut off bin Laden and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">al- Qaida</ENAMEX> terror network from sources of financing . 

That initial effort has substantially widened since then as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> government has mounted an international campaign to shut down all terrorists financiers . 

Roughly $ 124.5 million in financial assets belonging to terrorists groups , including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">al- Qaida</ENAMEX> , have been frozen worldwide since the attacks , according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury Department</ENAMEX> , which plays a lead role in the effort . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonner</ENAMEX> believes that most of the agents and analysts that would be added to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operation Green Quest</ENAMEX> would come from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX> by shifting some existing financial crimes and money-laundering experts to the task force . 

The rest would probably come from other agencies involved in the task force , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonner</ENAMEX> suggested . 

He did not say what other agencies , if any , had committed to assign more people . 

Given that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonner</ENAMEX> largely envisions existing experts being shifted to the task force , costs for the expansion should be minimal , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX> officials said . 

The task force operates out of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX> ' <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> headquarters . 

The task force also includes agents and analysts from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Internal Revenue Service</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Postal Inspection Service</ENAMEX> . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX> also plans to expand its overseas operations , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonner</ENAMEX> said . 

The service has about 30 overseas offices and plans to add three new locations . 

Two would be in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United Arab Emirates</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dubai</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Abudhabi</ENAMEX> -- important money-exchange centers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonner</ENAMEX> said . 

The third office would be set up in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bern</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Switzerland</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonner</ENAMEX> said . 

Since its inception , the task force 's work has resulted in 79 arrests , 70 indictments and 600 open investigations , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonner</ENAMEX> said . 

In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Operation Green Quest</ENAMEX> has seized nearly $ 33 million -- of which $ 21 million constituted smuggled currency and monetary instruments seized at the nation 's border .

As a concert pianist , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barrett Wissman</ENAMEX> believes top musicians should be able to play the finest instruments . 

As a financier and investor , he realizes they often ca n't afford those rare and expensive instruments themselves . 

About six years ago , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wissman</ENAMEX> formed an organization that buys expensive classical instruments -- many created by master craftsmen hundreds of years ago -- for the sole purpose of loaning them to those who can play them to the fullest . 

`` They 're at the top of their profession and they need an instrument that 's probably between $ 1 million and $ 4 million , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wissman</ENAMEX> , 40 , who is married to cellist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nina Kotova</ENAMEX> . 

Other wealthy benefactors have provided musicians with top instruments , but , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wissman</ENAMEX> said , `` some systematically , others on a case-by-case basis . 

I decided to start something to systematically help people . '' 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wissman</ENAMEX> has bought more than 10 instruments , mostly violins and cellos . 

He would n't give specific prices but said they can range from $ 100,000 to several million . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Adkins</ENAMEX> , the principal cellist of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dallas Symphony</ENAMEX> , played an instrument on loan from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wissman</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cremona Society Limited</ENAMEX> for four years . 

He said he could never have afforded the cello , made in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Rome</ENAMEX> in 1714 by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Tecchler</ENAMEX> . 

`` It 's just one of the really glorious instruments in the world , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adkins</ENAMEX> . 

Getting fine instruments into the hands of the best players results in great music and can boost a musician 's career , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Regh</ENAMEX> , vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Violin Society</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> violin and bow maker . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Toman</ENAMEX> , president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Federation of Violin and Bow Makers</ENAMEX> and a violin maker in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> , said handmade violins of good quality are in the $ 10,000 to $ 20,000 range , cellos from $ 20,000 to $ 40,000 . 

But , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toman</ENAMEX> said , `` when you come to the old Cremonese Strads and Guarneris -- a million to the sky 's the limit . '' 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antonio Stradivari</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Guarnerius del Gesu</ENAMEX> worked in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cremona</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italy</ENAMEX> , the center of high-quality violin-making from the mid-17th century to the mid-18th century . 

`` Because of the collectible value of these things -- and they cannot be recreated new -- they 've gone way up in value , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wissman</ENAMEX> said . 

`` Where can you think of another object that has art value , that is also actively used , something that 's 300 years old that somebody uses as a day-to-day instrument in their profession ? '' 

There is a degree of risk in dealing with such expensive items , as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wissman</ENAMEX> found out when a Stradivarius turned up missing this year . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cremona Society Limited</ENAMEX> sued <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christophe Landon Rare Violins</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , claiming the workshop was negligent in losing the 1714 Golden Period Stradivarius while acting as an agent for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cremona</ENAMEX> in the violin 's possible sale . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cremona</ENAMEX> attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Brewer</ENAMEX> said the lawsuit asks for damages of up to $ 4 million , the instrument 's estimated value . 

Insurance paid $ 1.9 million , he said . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Landon</ENAMEX> , who builds , restores and sells violins , cellos and violas , told police he left the violin with a client in a private room , then discovered it missing two days later . 

The company that insured the violin pulled the insurance on other Cremona instruments , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wissman</ENAMEX> now keeps the more expensive pieces , including the cello that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Adkins</ENAMEX> had been playing , in safekeeping . 

A 266-year -old instrument used by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> -based concert violinist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kurt Nikkanen</ENAMEX> for the last five years is in safekeeping , but he also has use through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cremona</ENAMEX> of a violin made by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pietro Grulli</ENAMEX> in 1890 instead . 

It 's an excellent instrument , he said , but handles differently . 

`` I have n't found one violin that compares to my Guarneri , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nikkanen</ENAMEX> . 

`` That sound that you hear under your ear , you ca n't imagine being without it . '' 

A teenager was charged with first-degree murder for allegedly killing a romantic rival by spiking his soda with cyanide . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ryan Furlough</ENAMEX> , 18 , laced his friend 's drink with the poison as they played video games in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Furlough</ENAMEX> 's basement in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ellicot City</ENAMEX> in suburban <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baltimore</ENAMEX> , police said Thursday . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benjamin Vassiliev</ENAMEX> , 17 , went into respiratory arrest last Friday after drinking the soda and died Wednesday . 

Police found a letter in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vassiliev</ENAMEX> 's house indicating <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Furlough</ENAMEX> was in love with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vassiliev</ENAMEX> 's girlfriend , according to court documents . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Furlough</ENAMEX> told police he had been thinking about killing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vassiliev</ENAMEX> since October , the documents show . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Furlough</ENAMEX> also faces reckless endangerment and poisoning charges , said police spokeswoman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sherry Llewellyn</ENAMEX> . 

Police said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Furlough</ENAMEX> bought the cyanide with his mother 's credit card in November . 

The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Louisville</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kentucky</ENAMEX> -based chemical supplier that sold the poison , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Antec Inc.</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vassiliev</ENAMEX> inquired about the chemical over the Internet , but placed the order by phone . 

He told the company he planned to use the substance to plate metal . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Furlough</ENAMEX> 's parents , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Furlough</ENAMEX> , apologized in a statement issued Wednesday by their son 's lawyer . 

`` We are so sorry for the pain and suffering our son <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ryan</ENAMEX> has caused <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben</ENAMEX> and his family , '' the statement reads . 

`` Our hearts go out to all those individuals involved . ''

A former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Roman Catholic</ENAMEX> priest pleaded guilty Thursday to sexually abusing a teenager more than 20 years ago , and agreed to cooperate in a probe of alleged misconduct and cover-ups within the diocese . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Maurice Giandelone</ENAMEX> pleaded guilty to two felony counts of sexual conduct and a third count was dismissed . 

He was ordered held without bond until sentencing Feb. 7 . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giandelone</ENAMEX> served a six-month jail sentence for abusing another teen in 1984 . 

As part of a plea agreement , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giandelone</ENAMEX> promised to cooperate with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maricopa County</ENAMEX> prosecutors investigating how much Bishop <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas O'Brien</ENAMEX> knew about alleged abuses , and whether he advised families whose children said they were abused not to contact police . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Brien</ENAMEX> has acknowledged that about 50 priests , former priests and church employees have been accused of criminal sexual misconduct with minors in the diocese during the past three decades . 

He has vowed to cooperate with authorities , but has declined to discuss the investigation publicly , citing grand jury secrecy laws . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giandelone</ENAMEX> , 55 , was arrested Dec. 3 in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fort Myers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fla.</ENAMEX> , and extradited to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> . 

He was accused of molesting a 16-year -old boy while he was a priest at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Joseph 's Catholic Church</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phoenix</ENAMEX> . 

The victim , now 39 , told authorities about the molestation after other alleged priest abuse victims came forward in recent months . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giandelone</ENAMEX> declined to speak to reporters Thursday as he was led back to his jail cell . 

His attorney also declined comment . 

At sentencing , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giandelone</ENAMEX> faces just under two years in prison , probation and a $ 150,000 fine . 

Authorities said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giandelone</ENAMEX> was transferred to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St. Mary 's</ENAMEX> church in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chandler</ENAMEX> in the 1980s and while there , he sexually abused another 15-year -old boy . 

Court records show <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giandelone</ENAMEX> spent six months in jail in that case , left the preisthood in 1992 and eventually moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> , where he registered as a sexual offender in 2000 . 

Meanwhile in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> , the leader of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Catholic</ENAMEX> lay reform group said Thursday that Bishop <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Lennon</ENAMEX> 's failure to meet with them after nearly a month in office raises concerns that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lennon</ENAMEX> is n't truly committed to openness and unity . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Voice of the Faithful</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Post</ENAMEX> said he requested a meeting in a letter sent Monday after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lennon</ENAMEX> did n't respond to informal requests . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lennon</ENAMEX> was appointed Dec. 13 to replace Cardinal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Law</ENAMEX> as head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boston Archdiocese</ENAMEX> . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donna Morrissey</ENAMEX> , a spokeswoman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">archdiocese</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lennon</ENAMEX> has been busy with new duties , meeting with personnel and fielding numerous requests for meetings . 

`` Certainly , we want to respond to the community of the faithful , which includes members of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Voice of the Faithful</ENAMEX> , '' she said . 

`` We want to have an open dialogue with the community as a whole . ''

Starting next month , sea carriers must provide details of the contents of sea containers destined for this country 24 hours before the cargo is loaded onto ships at foreign ports , the chief of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Customs Service</ENAMEX> said . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX> Commissioner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Bonner</ENAMEX> put carriers and shippers on notice Thursday that the service will begin enforcing the rule on Feb. 2 as originally planned . 

The rule was put in place Dec. 2 with a 60-day grace period , giving sea carriers time to come into compliance . 

Although no formal requests were made to the agency to extend the grace period , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonner</ENAMEX> said that informally there have been rumblings among some carriers hoping for more time . 

`` We ca n't roll this back any further , '' he said . 

The new rule is aimed at preventing terrorists from bringing nuclear and other deadly weapons into the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> . 

Many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> and foreign sea carriers for years have been voluntarily giving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX> advance cargo information , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Customs</ENAMEX> may not get the information until a few days before a ship carrying the cargo reaches a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> port . 

Years after his angry , politically pointed lyrics were tagged with helping bring on a coup in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ivory Coast</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Africa</ENAMEX> 's leading reggae star is trying to inspire with a new message for his warring <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West African</ENAMEX> homeland : peace . 

Chain -smoking in his hotel room on a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West African</ENAMEX> tour , his voice thick with emotion , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alpha Blondy</ENAMEX> makes an impassioned appeal for cool tempers in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ivory Coast</ENAMEX> , where a rebellion that began Sept. 19 has torn apart the once stable nation . 

`` If we do n't find a quick solution now , tomorrow will be too late , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blondy</ENAMEX> says . 

`` We wo n't be talking about an uprising of a few rebels -- we 'll be talking about a war that will last maybe 20 years or more . '' 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blondy</ENAMEX> , a 50-year -old native of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ivory Coast</ENAMEX> , made his name and his following bringing reggae from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> -- discovering reggae in a 1970s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> concert by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jamaican</ENAMEX> legends <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burning Spear</ENAMEX> . 

His latest reggae album , `` Merci , '' was nominated for a Grammy . 

In the decades since -- most particularly the last -- he 's released numerous songs warning of the dangers of tribalism , racism , injustice and inequality . 

All such evils , he says , have flourished in his home country , fostered by greedy politicians since the death of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ivory Coast</ENAMEX> 's first president , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felix Houphouet - Boigny</ENAMEX> . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blondy</ENAMEX> 's works include a CD titled `` SOS Tribal War '' and a song called `` Civil War , '' whose warnings of an uprising against an entrenched president ring today as an uncannily accurate prediction of the crisis in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ivory Coast</ENAMEX> . 

The world 's largest cocoa producer , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ivory Coast</ENAMEX> for long years after independence from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> in 1960 had been considered a bulwark of political and economic stability on the continent . 

Then in 1999 , soldiers overthrew <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ivory Coast</ENAMEX> 's elected government , accusing it of corruption , ineffectiveness and discrimination against northerners . 

Coup forces announced their takeover on a station that played the songs of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blondy</ENAMEX> and others beloved by the opposition . 

Some called it <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ivory Coast</ENAMEX> 's `` reggae revolution '' -- marked by junta soldiers cruising the streets in vehicles whose stereos blasted the words of Jah . 

Rather than ending corrupt rule , however , the coup has ushered in chaos and ethnic , regional and political bloodletting . 

Today , the rebellion that began with a new Sept. 19 coup attempt has divided the country , killed hundreds , caused thousands to flee their homes and threatened the country 's very survival . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ivory Coast</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blondy</ENAMEX> fears , is teetering on the brink of genocide . 

`` Machine guns sing louder than me . 

My little voice cannot overcome the deadly music of machine guns and rockets , '' he says , while not hesitating to offer peace proposals from his platform as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ivory Coast</ENAMEX> 's most-famous artist . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blondy</ENAMEX> says the only winners in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ivory Coast</ENAMEX> will be the world 's arms merchants , who are supplying both the government forces and the rebel groups with weapons . 

`` Those who sell the weapons do n't give a damn about who is killing who , about who is genociding who . 

They do n't know the faces , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blondy</ENAMEX> says . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blondy</ENAMEX> says politicians have lost control of the crisis . 

His role is to steer a middle course , he says , taking no side so that he can fight for peace . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blondy</ENAMEX> calls for the abolition of the entrenched concept of `` Ivoirite , '' an emphasis on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ivory Coast</ENAMEX> as a nation for the native-born rather than for the millions of immigrants who have come here from other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">African</ENAMEX> countries . 

He called it `` black Nazism . '' 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blondy</ENAMEX> -- never hesitant to tackle policy in his songs and in his comments -- suggested that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">French</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West African</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> forces deploy in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ivory Coast</ENAMEX> to keep the peace , staying until 2005 . 

More than 2,000 <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">French</ENAMEX> troops already are in the former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">French</ENAMEX> colony , and more than 1,000 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West African</ENAMEX> regional peacekeepers are scheduled to arrive soon . 

Other <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ivory Coast</ENAMEX> reggae artists , equally outspoken , disagree sharply with their mentor -- including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tiken Jah Fakoly</ENAMEX> , who says the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">French</ENAMEX> presence will only spur massacres . 

In the meantime , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blondy</ENAMEX> says , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX> should oversee elections in which all are allowed to compete . 

His suggestion addresses a trigger point in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ivory Coast</ENAMEX> 's tensions -- barring of northern-backed opposition leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alassane Ouattara</ENAMEX> from presidential elections . 

For years , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ivory Coast</ENAMEX> 's southern -based government has insisted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ouattara</ENAMEX> 's parents are foreign-born -- making him a non-citizen , and shut out of the presidential race . 

`` They say shut up you who came from far away ... this is not democracy , or multiparty politics , this is tribalism and it will bring all kinds of conflicts , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blondy</ENAMEX> sang in `` Multipartism '' in 1992 -- another song pinpointing with eerie reggae clairvoyance causes of troubles that were then still a decade away . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blondy</ENAMEX> performed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mali</ENAMEX> over New Year 's as part of an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">African</ENAMEX> tour to mark 20 years of his successful musical career . 

His concert in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ouagadougou</ENAMEX> , capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burkina Faso</ENAMEX> , was abruptly canceled last month by the authorities , whom he has criticized in a song about the unsolved 1998 killing of journalist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norbert Zongo</ENAMEX> . 

After <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bamako</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ivory Coast</ENAMEX> reggae singer was headed to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cameroon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guinea</ENAMEX> , although , as he told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Associated Press</ENAMEX> , `` I do n't have the heart to sing now . 

My heart is bleeding for my bleeding land . '' 

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> stocks fell Friday morning as companies sold shares held in business partners and other companies . 

The dollar was higher against the yen . 

The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average slid 39.47 points , or 0.46 percent , to 8,458.46 points at midday . 

The Nikkei lost 19.87 points , or 0.23 percent , to close at 8,497.93 points Thursday . 

The dollar bought 119.72 yen at 11 a.m. -LRB- 0200 GMT -RRB- Friday , up 0.88 yen from late Thursday in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> and above its level of 119.40 yen late Thursday in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> . 

Traders said the unwinding of cross-held shares by companies -- in which companies sell shares they held in clients and other companies bought to cement business ties -- sent benchmark averages lower . 

Many <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japanese</ENAMEX> companies have been gradually selling their holdings in other companies in recent years as the value of those shares has fallen and owning them has become less beneficial financially . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dai Nippon Printing</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fujisawa Pharmaceuticals</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mitsubishi Materials</ENAMEX> were among the losing issues Thursday morning .

The TOPIX shed 0.22 points , or 0.03 percent , to finish at 839.33 points Thursday . 

In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> Thursday , stocks bounced back after a drop in jobless claims raised hopes that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economy is recovering .

Although the title of his 2000 album , `` G.O.A.T. , '' stands for `` greatest of all time , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LL Cool J</ENAMEX> considers himself a humble man . 

`` I do n't get cocky and start thinking I know everything about the music or like I know everything about what people want to hear , '' says the Grammy -winning rapper-actor , who was born <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Todd Smith</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Queens</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> . 

He took the name <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LL Cool J</ENAMEX> -- `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ladies Love Cool James</ENAMEX> '' -- when he was a teenager , dropping out of school to pursue music . 

His 1990 album , `` Mama Said Knock You Out , '' established him as one of hip-hop 's superstars . 

`` Every time I do a record , it 's from the heart . ... 

It 's just a chance for me to express myself on a different level , '' said the 34-year -old , who sports a tattoo of a crowned microphone on his right arm . 

`` Obviously everybody ca n't like every song , and I know that , but I try to make them all as good as I can . '' 

`` Luv U Better , '' from 2002 's `` 10 '' album , climbed into the top five on the Billboard music chart . 

And although his 10-album deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Def Jam</ENAMEX> expired with `` 10 , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LL Cool</ENAMEX> J plans to continue recording . 

`` I 'm an unsigned artist , '' he said . 

The star of the ` 90s sitcom `` In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> '' has three upcoming films , the romantic comedy `` Deliver Us From <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eva</ENAMEX> , '' which will be released in early February ; `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S.W.A.T.</ENAMEX> '' with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel L. Jackson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Colin Farrell</ENAMEX> ; and the thriller `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mindhunters</ENAMEX> , '' also starring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Val Kilmer</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christian Slater</ENAMEX> . 

1 . 

Do you ever listen to other artists to see what 's out before you go into the studio ? 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LL Cool J</ENAMEX> : I listen to the radio , I buy records , and I listen as a fan . 

I do n't critique other albums in order to see what I 'm up against because I 'm not up against anything . 

So I just do my music . 

No one is going to buy an <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LL Cool J</ENAMEX> record expecting to hear someone else . 

2 . 

What was the inspiration behind `` Luv U Better '' ? 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LL Cool J</ENAMEX> : My personal relationships , the things I 've been through , the mistakes I 've made in my life . 

-LRB- I 'm -RRB- just tapping into that sincerity . 

3 . 

In the video for `` Luv U Better , '' your body looks really toned . 

How long did you work out for that ? 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LL Cool J</ENAMEX> : I literally -LRB- worked out -RRB- for the last year and a half or so . 

I had to gain weight for a couple of movies . 

But once I was done with those roles , I said , ` OK , now I have an opportunity to get back in the gym and lose all that weight . ' 

4 . 

What do you say when people comment on your looks ? 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LL Cool J</ENAMEX> : I do n't even think about that . 

I 'm not a dude that 's trying to be cute . 

There are a lot of guys that are prettier than me so I do n't get caught up . 

5 . 

Would you encourage your four children to rap ? 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">LL Cool J</ENAMEX> : I would encourage them to pursue whatever dreams they have . 

I would help them with anything . 

I 'm going to always help my kids . 

I have to do that . 

And I want to .

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FOP</ENAMEX> is the nation 's largest law enforcement labor organization , with more than 300,000 members . 

`` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Young</ENAMEX> committed his life to protecting his community and to supporting law enforcement officers across our nation , '' Attorney General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Ashcroft</ENAMEX> said in a statement . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Young</ENAMEX> was also an active duty police officer , serving as a lieutenant in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marion City Police Department</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> , until his death . 

During his career , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Young</ENAMEX> helped create the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohio Labor Council</ENAMEX> , with more than 8,000 members . 

The group aims to improve the effectiveness of management and labor negotiations within police forces . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Young</ENAMEX> is survived by his wife , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Denise</ENAMEX> , two sons , three sisters and his mother . 

Entertainment highlights during the week of Jan. 12-18 : In 1986 , former members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sex Pistols</ENAMEX> sued former manager <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm McLaren</ENAMEX> . 

The lawsuit was settled out of court .

In 1996 , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lisa Marie Presley</ENAMEX> filed for divorce from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Jackson</ENAMEX> .

In 2002 , `` The Fantasticks '' closed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greenwich Village</ENAMEX> . 

It was the longest-running musical in the world . 

It had begun production in 1960 and had been performed 17,162 times . 

Airline executives told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> that their companies still face major financial problems that probably will worsen if <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> goes to war with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> . 

Air travel has yet to return to pre- Sept . 

11 levels . 

The number of people flying in November was down almost 18 percent from November 2000 , according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> . 

Since the attacks , the major airlines have laid off more than 80,000 employees , cut wages for others and reduced the number of flights , but they still expect to lose $ 9 billion last year . 

Two have filed for bankruptcy in the last six months -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Air Lines</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Airways</ENAMEX> . 

`` We 've got most of the airlines broke and the rest of them begging , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernest Hollings</ENAMEX> said Thursday . 

War in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> could make a bad situation even worse , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> chief executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don Carty</ENAMEX> told the committee . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has twice helped the airlines since Sept. 11 . 

In November 2001 , President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush</ENAMEX> signed into law a $ 15 billion aid package that included $ 5 billion in cash assistance and a $ 10 billion loan guarantee program . 

Last year , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> enacted a law to extend government-issued war-risk insurance and to limit liability against companies for the terrorist attacks , saving airlines an estimated $ 1 billion . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carty</ENAMEX> said airlines need more , but he said they have yet to reach consensus on what <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> can do to help . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest Airlines</ENAMEX> ' Chief Executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Anderson</ENAMEX> also testified that the airlines need relief . 

The committe pledge to look at these issues : _Are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> airports adequately protected from anti-aircraft missiles , such as the one fired at an <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israeli</ENAMEX> jet in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX> last year ? 

_Should the limit on foreign investment in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> airlines be raised ? 

And are foreign governments unfairly subsidizing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airbus Industries</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">European</ENAMEX> manufacturer that is the chief rival to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing Co .</ENAMEX> ? 

Lawmakers also raised concerns that airline agreements to book passengers on each other 's flights are anticompetitive . 

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> is considering a proposal for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> to enter into such an alliance .

A moderate earthquake jolted much of central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> late Thursday , sending panicked residents spilling into the streets in downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico City</ENAMEX> but causing no reported injuries or damage . 

The 5.3-magnitude quake struck shortly after 8 p.m . 

-LRB- 0200 GMT -RRB- and was centered just off the coast of western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guerrero</ENAMEX> state , 30 miles -LRB- 50 kilometers -RRB- west of the resort city of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Autonomous University of Mexico</ENAMEX> 's earthquake center reported . 

In a telephone interview <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sabas de la Rosa</ENAMEX> , head of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Acapulco</ENAMEX> 's emergency response team , said the quake rattled high-rise hotels , homes and businesses for more than 20 seconds , but that authorities had n't received reports of injuries or damage . 

De <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">la Rosa</ENAMEX> said police were touring this city of close to 1 million to ensure the quake did not damage some of the area 's older homes or businesses . 

In downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico City</ENAMEX> , more than 180 miles -LRB- 290 kilometers -RRB- to the west , police reported that dozens of people fled homes and businesses and spilled into the street as the floors beneath them trembled . 

There were no reports of injuries or damage in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexican</ENAMEX> capital . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> is pulling out of the global nuclear arms control treaty , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korean</ENAMEX> news media said Friday . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Radio Station</ENAMEX> broadcast a government statement saying that the communist state was pulling out the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty . 

The report was carried by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea</ENAMEX> 's cable news network <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">YTN</ENAMEX> . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> said its withdrawal from the treaty will free it from safeguard obligations with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency</ENAMEX> . 

The announcement came as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> was awaiting a reply from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pyongyang</ENAMEX> about its decision to open dialogue to seek a peaceful resolution of the country 's nuclear weapons development . 

Two long-exiled rebel leaders who want a larger homeland for the Naga ethnic minority in northeast <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> met Thursday with the prime minister for talks aimed at ending one of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Asia</ENAMEX> 's longest running separatist conflicts . 

About 500 supporters in colorful shawls sang a Naga hymn when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isak Chishi Swu</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thuingaleng Muivah</ENAMEX> arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Delhi</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> for their first visit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indian</ENAMEX> capital in 37 years . 

Some men screamed war cries . 

The two rebel leaders , with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Socialist Council of Nagaland</ENAMEX> , met Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atal Bihari Vajpayee</ENAMEX> , whom they also met last year in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Osaka</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> . 

They were to meet Deputy Prime Minister and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Home</ENAMEX> Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lal Krishna Advani</ENAMEX> on Friday . 

The discussions will `` revolve around issues of devolution of power . 

Special status is what they want , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">K. Padmanabhaiah</ENAMEX> , the government 's chief negotiator , who greeted the rebel leaders at the airport . 

The rebel leaders are based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Thailand</ENAMEX> and have not lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> since their group was outlawed four decades ago , although they met with the late <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indian</ENAMEX> Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Indira Gandhi</ENAMEX> in 1967 in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calcutta</ENAMEX> . 

`` We are here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> because we hope to find a peaceful solution , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muivah</ENAMEX> said . 

More than 15,000 people have been killed since Naga rebels began fighting for a separate nation just before <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> gained independence from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> in 1947 . 

The rebels want special status for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nagaland</ENAMEX> state , which borders <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Myanmar</ENAMEX> and where most of the 2 million Nagas live in predominantly Hindu <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> . 

Most <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nagas</ENAMEX> are Christians . 

The latest talks cap a series of peace initiatives since the government and one rebel faction agreed to a cease-fire in 1997 . 

Talks were held in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Netherlands</ENAMEX> in July and the government lifted a 12-year ban against the group on Nov. 26 . 

Last month , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nagaland</ENAMEX> state government withdrew arrest warrants and criminal cases against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Muivah</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Swu</ENAMEX> to facilitate their travel within <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> . 

Among the contentious issues is the rebel demand that Naga -occupied areas in other northeastern states be unified with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nagaland</ENAMEX> . 

They claim as many Nagas live in the neighboring states of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Manipur</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Assam</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arunachal Pradesh</ENAMEX> as live in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nagaland</ENAMEX> itself . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Robert `` Radio '' Kennedy</ENAMEX> has been a local celebrity here for more than three decades . 

His lumbering jog leads the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">T.L. Hanna High School</ENAMEX> football team onto the field for every game . 

He greets fans entering the stadium with a handshake or a hug . 

He barks instructions from the sidelines -- `` Get da quarterback ! '' -- and at halftime may serve hot dogs at the concession stand or go onto the field to play an imaginary game for fans . 

Now <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Radio</ENAMEX> 's experiences at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanna</ENAMEX> are the subject of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Columbia Pictures</ENAMEX> movie , `` Radio , '' starring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cuba Gooding Jr.</ENAMEX> and due out this fall . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Radio</ENAMEX> , 56 , is mentally disabled and cannot read or write . 

He has been enrolled in the school 's special education program for decades , and has become a beloved figure in the community . 

`` He 's going to help the kids bridge that gap of how to accept the mentally challenged , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave Koch</ENAMEX> , 44 , who has a daughter at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hanna</ENAMEX> and praises <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Radio</ENAMEX> 's infectious personality . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Radio</ENAMEX> also is black , and some say his close connection with the largely white school since before integration has helped promote racial understanding . 

`` To a great extent , this one mentally challenged man really transformed this community and the way they look at the world , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Tollin</ENAMEX> , director of the upcoming movie . 

The film focuses on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Radio</ENAMEX> 's relationship with the school 's football coach , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold Jones</ENAMEX> , now 68 and retired -LRB- played in the movie by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Harris</ENAMEX> -RRB- . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> and other members of the athletic department befriended <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Radio</ENAMEX> when he started hanging around practices , mimicking the players . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Radio</ENAMEX> took on more and more responsibilities with the team , including honorary titles as manager and assistant coach . 

`` He was really just like a fixture , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> said . 

`` It was n't no big deal , you know what I mean . 

He was there , and he kind of just grew on us , and we grew on him as time went on . '' 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> ' stories about his buddy include one in which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Radio</ENAMEX> ate all of the track team 's sandwiches in one sitting . 

`` That was n't funny at the time , '' he said with a laugh . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Radio</ENAMEX> also is known for his annual talent-show performance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Brown</ENAMEX> 's `` I Got You -LRB- I Feel Good -RRB- . '' 

`` That innocence is what 's so wonderful about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Radio</ENAMEX> because he 's just who he is , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tollin</ENAMEX> , whose projects have included `` Hard Ball , '' `` Summer Catch '' and the documentary `` Chasing the Dream '' about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hank Aaron</ENAMEX> . 

`` You get him -- unfettered , unedited , uncensored -- and after awhile I think what happened is people are drawn to that energy . 

It 's so refreshing . '' 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anderson County</ENAMEX> is about 80 percent white , according to the 2000 Census , and senior cheerleader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meredith Howard</ENAMEX> said people look at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanna</ENAMEX> as a `` rich , white school . '' 

`` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Radio</ENAMEX> is not a color . 

He is a person , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard</ENAMEX> , 17 . 

`` He pretty much is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hanna</ENAMEX> . '' 

`` You ca n't look at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Radio</ENAMEX> and not smile , '' she said after the two danced on the sidelines during a break in the cheers . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Radio</ENAMEX> lives with his older brother and sister-in-law . 

He catches the schoolbus to the high school . 

School officials say he has the mental capacity of a young child . 

`` I going to see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cuba</ENAMEX> , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Radio</ENAMEX> said recently before going to visit a production crew filming his story in nearby <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Walterboro</ENAMEX> . 

He got his nickname 30 years ago riding around town on a grocery cart with a transistor radio , and the name still fits . 

At a recent Friday night football game , he pulled a radio from his pocket and pressed it to his ear , listening intently to the broadcast of the game happening in front of him . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> said he does n't know how <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Radio</ENAMEX> 's story got so popular . 

In addition to the movie , which co-stars <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Debra Winger</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> ' wife , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda</ENAMEX> , it has been featured by `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Good Morning America</ENAMEX> , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sports Illustrated</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFL Films</ENAMEX> . 

`` Sometimes you can understand him and sometimes on new stuff it 's hard to understand him , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jones</ENAMEX> said . 

`` Then I have to ask him two or three times before I can understand it . 

My wife says he talks too fast . '' 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miragene Lever</ENAMEX> , 32 , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radio</ENAMEX> 's special needs teacher , said he used to frustrate educators and be the target of bullies . 

His outgoing personality , however , and his growing acceptance by the community helped him and inspired others , she said , including her other disabled students . 

`` He knows how to touch everyone 's heart , '' she said . 

Boomers , here 's another sign you 're not 25 anymore . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patty Duke</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helen Keller</ENAMEX> in `` The Miracle Worker , '' 1960s TV icon and pill-popping heroine of `` Valley of the Dolls '' -- has joined the cast of the Broadway revival of `` Oklahoma ! '' 

No , not as winsome , love-struck <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laurey</ENAMEX> , but as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aunt Eller</ENAMEX> , the flinty matriarch whose maternal presence hovers over the classic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rodgers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hammerstein</ENAMEX> musical . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duke</ENAMEX> 's show-biz career has spanned more than four decades , but it 's those three roles that are etched in the memories of fans of a certain age . 

After all , they grew up inspired by the stage and movie versions of `` The Miracle Worker . '' 

The film won <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duke</ENAMEX> an Academy Award for her portrayal of the blind , deaf and wild little girl tamed by the tenacious <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Annie Sullivan</ENAMEX> . 

And they were regular viewers of `` The Patty Duke Show , '' the TV series about identical cousins -LRB- both played by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duke</ENAMEX> -RRB- -- `` one pair of matching bookends , different as night and day , '' according to the show 's insistent theme song . 

Later , they giggled their way through `` Valley of Dolls , '' a Hollywood trashfest of the highest order that these days , some 35 years after its initial release , has achieved bona fide cult status . 

Today , the object of all this adoration sits in a publicist 's office directly across the street from the anonymous high-rise that houses the theater where `` Oklahoma ! '' is playing . 

At 56 , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duke</ENAMEX> is , well , not 25 anymore , but a stylish matron , smartly done up in a maroon suit , a multicolored scarf draped around her neck , and wearing patent-leather pumps . 

Look closely though and the disarming smile is still the same as when she played <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patty</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cathy Lane</ENAMEX> on that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> sitcom from 1963 to 1966 . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duke</ENAMEX> is eager to embrace `` Oklahoma ! '' -- her first Broadway appearance since 1962 when she played a young girl with an incurable heart ailment in a short-lived flop called `` Isle of Children . '' 

`` I figure at my age , how many more chances was I going to get , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duke</ENAMEX> says . 

`` So I decided that if I 'm going to put my money where my mouth is , then I have to take this risk . 

Plus , there is some magical , mystical thing about the word ` Oklahoma . ' 

How do you say ` no ' to a show like ` Oklahoma ! ' '' 

For the last 12 years , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duke</ENAMEX> has lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Idaho</ENAMEX> with her fourth husband , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Pearce</ENAMEX> , and her youngest son , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin</ENAMEX> . 

Seven of those years have been down a dirt road on a ranch with assorted horses , goats , donkeys , dogs and even a llama or two . 

`` What I find there has to do with the earth and the animals , '' she says . 

`` Every time those llamas walk across a pasture , I think I 'm in a Christmas pageant . 

I find a kind of centerness that is very comfortable . '' 

Not bad preparation for playing someone imstilled with a pioneer spirit . 

`` What I feel that I have in common with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aunt Eller</ENAMEX> is my need and my sense of community , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duke</ENAMEX> explains . 

`` And my other need is for everybody to make nice . 

Do n't fight . 

We 'll get through this . 

`` This is a woman who has had strife in life , made her peace with some of it and has come to the point of acceptance . 

Not giving up . '' 

A mirror of her own life , perhaps ? 

`` Yes , '' she replies simply . 

That life , its volatile ups and downs , has been well documented not only in several books , including her autobiography , `` Call Me Anna , '' but in a television movie as well . 

Her marriages . 

Her battles with mental illness . 

Her turbulent relationships with her older children . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Idaho</ENAMEX> is a refuge , she says , from the clutter , noise and anger of big cities but not from herself . 

`` I do n't spend a lot of time analyzing myself anymore , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duke</ENAMEX> says . 

`` But I have found in the last couple of years , that I do n't think that I would have been able to be as settled a 56-year -old person if I had stayed in the city . '' 

What lures her back to show business is an occasional television movie , and something special , such as `` Oklahoma ! '' 

Despite her long career , the current Broadway revival is only <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duke</ENAMEX> 's second musical after a concert version of `` Follies '' she did last year in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> . 

Yet she jumped right in . 

`` I was n't surprised by her musical ability or her ability to be in a musical , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell Lemsky</ENAMEX> , production supervisor for `` Oklahoma ! '' 

It was Lemsky who rehearsed the actress for nearly four weeks before she went into the show in mid- December , replacing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrea Martin</ENAMEX> . 

`` When I was a kid , I thought I could sing -- then I thought I should never try that again , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duke</ENAMEX> says with a laugh . 

`` But in recent years , I 've been singing more around home and the horses do n't care and the llamas do n't care . '' 

So she started singing lessons with a voice teacher in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spokane</ENAMEX> and then dancing lessons . 

`` I do think of myself now as an actor who can sing and who can dance -- given the proper support and instruction , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duke</ENAMEX> says . 

`` And I 'm certainly getting that here . 

Everyone has been so kind . 

I find that if I dance with the love that I feel for the audience , I really can do it . '' 

`` I was surprised by how accessible and open she is , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lemsky</ENAMEX> says . 

`` She lets herself be known thoroughly , and her generosity in that way was overwhelming . 

It 's genuine , and she brings that quality to her playing of the part . 

She just does n't hold back . '' 

Hold back ? 

Not on your life . 

To this day , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duke</ENAMEX> finds it astonishing that total strangers come up to her in airports and sing the theme song to `` The Patty Duke Show . '' 

And she welcomes them . 

`` We grew up together . 

There were n't many other teenagers until <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sally Field</ENAMEX> did ` The Flying Nun . ' 

We had a commonality , '' she says . 

`` On a personal level , I love it . 

When you are going through life trying to figure out why you were born ... and then ... people , total strangers , say , ` I love you ' -- I do n't know if it gives me the full answer but it carries me on the quest . 

`` I think I was given a certain set of values by my parents that have stuck with me , '' she says , `` and from ` The Miracle Worker ' -- listening almost every night for almost two years to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Annie Bancroft</ENAMEX> playing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Annie Sullivan</ENAMEX> and saying , ` Giving up ? 

Why in my opinion , that 's the original sin . ' '' 

A pickup truck that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Border Patrol</ENAMEX> agents believed was carrying illegal immigrants flipped over during a high-speed chase , killing two people and injuring 13 , authorities said . 

The truck overturned shortly in southeastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego County</ENAMEX> , about 20 miles north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexican</ENAMEX> border , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Landeros</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">California Highway Patrol</ENAMEX> spokesman . 

Seven people were hospitalized in critical condition and one was listed as serious , according to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Heartland Fire Authority</ENAMEX> dispatcher . 

The others suffered minor injuries . 

An 18-month -old baby was among those hospitalized but the toddler 's condition was not immediately known , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Landeros</ENAMEX> said . 

The chase was begun by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Border Patrol</ENAMEX> officers who suspected a pickup truck covered by a tarp was carrying undocumented immigrants , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Landeros</ENAMEX> said . 

The truck struck a guard rail and hit other vehicles , but it was not known whether passengers in those vehicles were injured , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Landeros</ENAMEX> said . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Border Patrol</ENAMEX> spokeswoman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gloria Chavez</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> said she was waiting for more information from agents at the scene . 

The remote areas of eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego County</ENAMEX> are commonly used by smugglers driving vehicles crammed with illegal immigrants across the border . 

Selected audio release : `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucie</ENAMEX> de <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lammermoor</ENAMEX> , '' opera in three acts by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gaetano Donizetti -LRB- Virgin Classics</ENAMEX> , two CDs , $ 32.98 -RRB- No , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucie</ENAMEX> '' is n't a typo . 

`` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucie</ENAMEX> de <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lammermoor</ENAMEX> '' is the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">French</ENAMEX> language version that the composer introduced to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> in 1839 , four years after `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucia</ENAMEX> '' premiered in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Naples</ENAMEX> . 

It was widely performed for decades and in fact was the first version of the Romantic masterwork -- based on Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Scott</ENAMEX> 's novel `` The Bride of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lammermoor</ENAMEX> '' -- to reach the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Orleans</ENAMEX> in 1841 . 

Now , an impressive recording , starring soprano <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Natalie Dessay</ENAMEX> and tenor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberto Alagna</ENAMEX> , bids to put the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">French</ENAMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucie</ENAMEX> '' back on the map . 

They and the rest of the cast are recreating a highly successful production at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Opera de Lyon</ENAMEX> in early 2002 . 

In preparing the work for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donizetti</ENAMEX> did far more than merely translate the text from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italian</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">French</ENAMEX> . 

Though the famous `` Mad Scene '' with its fearsome coloratura is relatively unchanged , elsewhere there are vast differences structurally and musically . 

Gone altogether is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lucia</ENAMEX> 's confidante , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alisa</ENAMEX> ; her tutor , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raimondo</ENAMEX> , has a much reduced role ; the shadowy retainer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Normanno</ENAMEX> is replaced by the far more sinister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gilbert</ENAMEX> ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arturo</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucia</ENAMEX> 's hapless bridegroom , has a much bigger presence . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucie</ENAMEX> 's first aria now is not the haunting `` Regnavo nel silenzio '' with its morbid vision of doom , but a more generic prayer for happiness lifted from an earlier opera . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dessay</ENAMEX> , so spectacular in comic roles such as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olympia</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Offenbach</ENAMEX> 's `` The Tales of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hoffmann</ENAMEX> '' and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zerbinetta</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strauss</ENAMEX> ' `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ariadne</ENAMEX> auf <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Naxos</ENAMEX> , '' makes a most affecting tragic heroine , the purity of her sound adding to the pathos of the character . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alagna</ENAMEX> seems always most at home in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">French</ENAMEX> repertoire , where his command of the language and style lends authority to his ardent singing . 

As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucie</ENAMEX> 's conniving brother , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henri</ENAMEX> , baritone <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ludovic Tezier</ENAMEX> makes a strong contribution . 

The orchestra and chorus of the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Opera de Lyon</ENAMEX> are conducted with vigor and assurance by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Evelino Pido</ENAMEX> . 

-- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Silverman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> Writer 

You do n't need to go to a theater to see `` Just Married , '' because you 've already seen it . 

If you own a television , and if you 've turned it on within the past month , you could n't have avoided commercials for the movie , starring <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ashton Kutcher</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brittany Murphy</ENAMEX> as socio-economically mismatched newlyweds who bicker incessantly on their honeymoon . 

-LRB- The real-life off-screen couple has been everywhere lately , hosting the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VH1</ENAMEX> cable television network 's `` Big in 2002 Awards '' and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MTV</ENAMEX> cable Television network 's `` New Year 's Eve Pajama Party '' and appearing on every talk show in between . -RRB- 

So you 've had ample opportunity to see the movie 's big jokes , all of which are of the slapstick or gross-out variety : -- Blue -collar , wannabe sportscaster <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Leezak</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kutcher</ENAMEX> -RRB- meets cute , wealthy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wellesley</ENAMEX> art history major <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah McNerney</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murphy</ENAMEX> -RRB- when he tags her in the head with a football on the beach . 

-- On their wedding night , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX> bangs <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah</ENAMEX> 's head against the threshold while carrying her into the honeymoon suite . 

-- Flying to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> for their honeymoon , they get stuck in the bathroom while trying to join the mile-high club . 

-- At an historic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">French</ENAMEX> hotel , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX> tries to plug in an appliance -- let 's just say it 's of the adult variety -- and short-circuits the wiring . 

Later , at a run-down <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Italian</ENAMEX> hotel , he and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah</ENAMEX> crash through a wall and onto the bed next door , where another couple is having sex . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah</ENAMEX> 's ex-boyfriend , a generically wealthy pretty boy named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christian Kane</ENAMEX> -RRB- , just happens to be in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> at the same time , and wants to win her back . 

This sets up more obvious misunderstandings and fights , which involve 10-pound ashtrays and fireplace pokers . 

By the end , they 're so frustrated , they 're purposely pummeling each other . 

But it 's hard to believe that their characters would ever get together in the first place , much less get back together -- and it 's even harder to care . 

That 's a problem , because that 's the whole point of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam Harper</ENAMEX> 's script , which he based on his own horrific honeymoon . 

It does n't help that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shawn Levy</ENAMEX> directs with the same overbearing tone he used in last year 's `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Big Fat Liar</ENAMEX> , '' a movie remarkable only for rendering the adorable <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frankie Muniz</ENAMEX> absolutely obnoxious . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harper</ENAMEX> tries to infuse the movie with a kind of `` Barefoot in the Park '' sexual tension , but with none of the witty banter . 

While <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murphy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kutcher</ENAMEX> are n't exactly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane Fonda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Redford</ENAMEX> , they 're likable enough -- at least they are individually . 

Together , they 're shrill and annoying . 

Ripping more than a few pages from the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Lampoon</ENAMEX> 's European Vacation '' script , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX> is always the ugly American , and the locals are depicted as singularly snooty and insulting . 

Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Murphy</ENAMEX> brings a natural charm to everything she does , from her voiceover work on the animated `` King of the Hill '' to her co-starring role as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eminem</ENAMEX> 's girlfriend last year in `` 8 Mile . '' 

And when she 's ranting in Italian , she bears a brief but striking resemblance to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Federico Fellini</ENAMEX> 's muse , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Giulietta Masina</ENAMEX> , with her bleach-blond hair , tiny frame and enormous brown eyes . 

Similarly , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kutcher</ENAMEX> has a comfortable goofiness that makes him easy to watch on the sitcom `` That ' 70s Show . '' 

And I 'll admit it , I even liked him in `` Dude , Where 's My Car ? '' 

There 's even a moment in `` Just Married '' that has the manic energy of `` Dude , Where 's My Car ? '' when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX> tries to ram the front gates of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sarah</ENAMEX> 's family 's mansion in his beat-up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dodge</ENAMEX> with his idiot best friend , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kyle</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Moscow</ENAMEX> -RRB- , in the passenger seat . 

It 's enough to make you long for that movie -- that 's when you know the honeymoon is really over . 

`` Just Married , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">20th Century Fox</ENAMEX> release , runs 95 minutes . 

One and a half stars out of four . 

World No. 4 <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan Carlos Ferrero</ENAMEX> overcame <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rainer Schuettler</ENAMEX> 3-6 , 6-3 , 6-2 Friday to advance to the final at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sydney International</ENAMEX> . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferrero</ENAMEX> , seeded second , rallied from a set and break down in the second to win in 1 hour , 40 minutes . 

Runner -up at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tennis Masters Cup</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> last November , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ferrero</ENAMEX> is hot favorite in Saturday 's championship match against the winner of the against the winner of the other semifinal between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Hyung -taik</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wayne Ferreira</ENAMEX> . 

In women 's semifinals , second-seeded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim Clijsters</ENAMEX> was against third-seeded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Justine Henin</ENAMEX> in an all- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgian</ENAMEX> encounter and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lindsay Davenport</ENAMEX> was against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tatiana Panova</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> . 

President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has no timetable for determining whether to forcibly disarm <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> said Thursday after hinting for weeks that a decision would quickly follow a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> report at the end of the month . 

A report from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> weapons inspectors , now two months into their search for nuclear , chemical and biological weapons in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> , is due Jan. 27 . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> officials had indicated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> would decide shortly thereafter whether a military confrontation was necessary to rid <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> of the weapons of mass destruction the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> believes he has . 

On Thursday , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ari Fleischer</ENAMEX> termed the deadline merely `` an important reporting date . '' 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fleischer</ENAMEX> also suggested that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> ' military buildup could be useful as a tactic to prod the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraqi</ENAMEX> leader to comply with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> requirements . 

`` The military has effective influence on diplomacy and making sure that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> understands that he needs to comply , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fleischer</ENAMEX> said . 

`` Because if he does n't , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> has the means and the ability to make him comply . '' 

Underscoring war preparations , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Corps</ENAMEX> said it had taken the unusual step of stopping all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marines</ENAMEX> , active-duty as well as reserve , from leaving the service for the coming 12 months . 

The last time the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marines</ENAMEX> took this action , known as `` stop-loss , '' was during the buildup to the 1991 Gulf War , said Capt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gabrielle Chapin</ENAMEX> , a spokeswoman at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Combat Development Command</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Quantico</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Va .</ENAMEX> 

At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> , the administration cast the inspectors ' assessment Thursday of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> 's 12,000-page weapons declaration as supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> position that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> has so far failed to prove it does not possess banned weapons . 

Chief weapons inspector <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hans Blix</ENAMEX> , who delivered the assessment to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N. Security Council</ENAMEX> , said that no `` smoking guns '' had been found . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blix</ENAMEX> , however , also said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> 's claim it has no weapons of mass destruction in violation of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> resolution is impossible to verify because its declaration left out so much information . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fleischer</ENAMEX> cited portions of the inspectors ' briefing that chided <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> for merely maintaining it does not have weapons of mass destruction , instead of presenting credible evidence to prove it , and for failing to resolve questions about missile engine imports , the chemical agent VX and the full list of scientists who worked on weapons of mass destruction programs . 

`` The problem with guns that are hidden is you ca n't see their smoke , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fleischer</ENAMEX> said . 

`` We know for a fact that there are weapons there . '' 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blix</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Atomic Energy Agency</ENAMEX> head <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mohamed ElBaradei</ENAMEX> said the inspections process needs more time . 

`` We are in the middle of a process , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British</ENAMEX> Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Blair</ENAMEX> said in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> . 

He has been a key ally of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> in rallying world opinion to confront <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> . 

Meanwhile , thousands of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">American</ENAMEX> forces are streaming into areas south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Qatar</ENAMEX> . 

However , a deal remains elusive for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> military to examine which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkish</ENAMEX> bases , considered key staging grounds along <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> 's northern border , could be used , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> officials said . 

The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> has offered incentives , but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkish</ENAMEX> leaders hesitant to defy popular opinion in their Muslim country have been reluctant . 

On one specific weapons matter , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">ElBaradei</ENAMEX> said aluminum tubes obtained by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> were not suitable for enriching uranium for use in a nuclear weapon . 

But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fleischer</ENAMEX> said the acquisitions , banned under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> resolution regardless of their purpose , remain a cause for concern . 

`` They are pursuing acquisition of elements that are banned to them that have purposes , that still can be used for military purposes , '' he said . 

`` We do have concerns about their potential of developing nuclear programs . '' 

Commissioner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bud Selig</ENAMEX> will probably brief owners next week on his plan to have the league that wins the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">All - Star</ENAMEX> game gain home-field advantage in the World Series . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Selig</ENAMEX> had said at the November owners ' meeting that he intends to reinvigorate the All - Star game , which last summer ended in a much mocked , 7-7 tie after 11 innings in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Milwaukee</ENAMEX> . 

Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American League</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National League</ENAMEX> ran out of pitchers , with managers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Torre</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Brenly</ENAMEX> using players for short stretches to get everybody in . 

Home -field advantage in the best-of-seven World Series has rotated each year . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob DuPuy</ENAMEX> , baseball 's chief operating officer , said this week that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Selig</ENAMEX> 's plan to have the team from the All - Star -winning league host Games 1 , 2 , 6 and 7 does n't require a vote by owners . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Baseball</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX> also are considering whether to have the start of the World Series pushed back from a Saturday to a Tuesday , perhaps as soon as this year . 

Games 1 and 6 , played on Saturdays , have been plagued by record-low ratings . 

In addition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fox</ENAMEX> is considering whether to drop two Saturday broadcasts in September , where they currently go up against college football , and using those slots earlier in the season . 

An abandoned farm in rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> was converted into a brothel run by local <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chinese</ENAMEX> triad gangsters , police said Friday after rounding up 119 people in vice raids . 

Prostitution is rampant in parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> and police crackdowns are frequent but authorities were quoted as saying the brothel in the old farm , made up of tin huts surrounded by a metal fence , was a surprise . 

`` It is the first time in my knowledge that we have discovered a brothel operating in a setting like this , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Organized Crime and Triad Bureau</ENAMEX> Superintendent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiu Ming -wah</ENAMEX> was quoted as telling the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South China Morning Post</ENAMEX> . 

Authorities busted the establishment as they carried out raids on 32 locations on Wednesday , arresting 29 men and 90 women . 

Local newspaper reports said the brothel in the poultry and pig farm employed sex workers from mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and operated 24-hour -a-day . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> said Friday that it has withdrawn from the global nuclear arms control treaty and denounced what it called <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> aggression , but said it had no plans to develop nuclear weapons . 

`` We can no longer remain bound to the -LRB- Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty -RRB- , allowing the country 's security and the dignity of our nation to be infringed upon , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korean</ENAMEX> government said in a statement carried on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCNA</ENAMEX> , its official news agency . 

In 1993 , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> also announced that it was withdrawing from the treaty , but later suspended the decision and entered talks with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> . 

`` Though we pull out of the NPT we have no intention to produce nuclear weapons and our nuclear activities at this stage will be confined only to peaceful purposes such as the production of electricity , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KCNA</ENAMEX> said . 

However , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korean</ENAMEX> action was likely to heighten tension over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> 's nuclear development as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and its allies seek a diplomatic solution to the problem . 

The announcement came as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> Gov. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Richardson</ENAMEX> , a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> ambassador , acted as a surprise intermediary between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> . 

He met Thursday night in his state with two envoys from the communist country in what observers hoped could augur an easing of tension . 

The withdrawal from the NPT could signal that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> plans to push ahead with its nuclear weapons programs , or that it is trying to pressure the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> into concessions with a tactic known as brinkmanship . 

`` The withdrawal from the NPT is a legitimate self-defensive measure taken against the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> moves to stifle the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">DPRK</ENAMEX> , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North</ENAMEX> 's news agency said . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> has repeatedly accused the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> of plotting to invade it , and has said it has the right to develop weapons for its self-defense . 

However , it has never publicly said that it has a nuclear weapons program . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1985 . 

It suspended its 1993 decision to withdraw from the treaty amid tension over its suspected nuclear weapons program . 

The crisis was defused a year later when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> agreed to freeze its facilities at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yongbyon</ENAMEX> under an energy deal with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> . 

Those facilities are the focus on the new crisis . 

The 1968 treaty is considered a cornerstone in the effort to stop the spread of nuclear weapons . 

Only four other countries -- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pakistan</ENAMEX> -- are not signatories , though <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cuba</ENAMEX> is a member of a treaty establishing a nuclear-free zone in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX> . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman Cechmanek</ENAMEX> made 24 saves for his first shutout of the season Thursday , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Desjardins</ENAMEX> had a goal and assist in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philadelphia Flyers</ENAMEX> ' 4-0 victory over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Islanders</ENAMEX> . 

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flyers</ENAMEX> have won five straight games and they snapped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York</ENAMEX> 's seven-game streak of earning at least one point -LRB- 6-0-0-1 -RRB- . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pavel Brendl</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeremy Roenick</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marty Murray</ENAMEX> also scored for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flyers</ENAMEX> , who won both visits to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Long Island</ENAMEX> this season by a combined score of 10-2 . 

It was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cechmanek</ENAMEX> 's 15th career shutout . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garth Snow</ENAMEX> gave regular <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islanders</ENAMEX> goalie <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris Osgood</ENAMEX> the night off and stopped 16 shots . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Snow</ENAMEX> 's last start was Dec. 14 , a 4-3 loss at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tampa Bay</ENAMEX> . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thrashers</ENAMEX> 3 , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lightning</ENAMEX> 2 , OT In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tampa</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ilya Kovalchuk</ENAMEX> scored his second goal of the game with 15.2 seconds remaining in overtime as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> beat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southeast Division</ENAMEX> -leading <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tampa Bay</ENAMEX> . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kovalchuk</ENAMEX> scored from the right circle soon after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> goalie <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Byron Dafoe</ENAMEX> stopped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent Lecavalier</ENAMEX> on a breakaway . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lecavalier</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave Andreychuk</ENAMEX> scored power-play goals in the third period as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lightning</ENAMEX> rallied to a 2-2 tie . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Hrkac</ENAMEX> also scored for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> , which has the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHL</ENAMEX> 's second-worst record -LRB- 11-24-2-4 -RRB- . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadiens</ENAMEX> 3 , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rangers</ENAMEX> 2 In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montreal</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marcel Hossa</ENAMEX> scored his second goal in as many games since being recalled from the minor leagues to lift <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montreal</ENAMEX> over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Rangers</ENAMEX> . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hossa</ENAMEX> scored with 13 : 37 remaining in the third period as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Montreal</ENAMEX> ended a season-high seven-game winless streak . 

The teams were tied 2-2 in the first period . 

Defensemen <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl Dykhuis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrei Markov</ENAMEX> also scored for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canadiens</ENAMEX> , who had n't played at home since a 6-2 win over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Buffalo</ENAMEX> on Dec. 21 . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew Barnaby</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamie Lundmark</ENAMEX> scored for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York</ENAMEX> , 4-10-2-1 in its last 17 games . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maple Leafs</ENAMEX> 4 , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penguins</ENAMEX> 2 In <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toronto</ENAMEX> allowed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> 's league-leading power play to convert only 1-of-9 chances without the injured <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mario Lemieux</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nik Antropov</ENAMEX> scored the decisive goal in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Toronto</ENAMEX> 's victory . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Travis Green</ENAMEX> scored short-handed and also helped set up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jyrki Lumme</ENAMEX> 's goal with 2 1/2 minutes gone as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maple Leafs</ENAMEX> went 3-1 in the season series , winning twice in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antropov</ENAMEX> also assisted on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Mogilny</ENAMEX> 's empty-net goal in the final minute . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> rallied from a 2-0 deficit to tie it on second-period goals by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shean Donovan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve McKenna</ENAMEX> . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lemieux</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NHL</ENAMEX> 's leading scorer , missed only his second game of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Penguins</ENAMEX> ' 42 games this season and his first because of an injury , a sore groin that also might keep him out of Saturday 's game against the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rangers</ENAMEX> .

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oracle</ENAMEX> racing team denied Friday it will have actor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Cruise</ENAMEX> on board during one of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">America 's Cup</ENAMEX> challenger final races on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Auckland</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hauraki Gulf</ENAMEX> . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cruise</ENAMEX> is in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX> filming `` The Last Samurai , '' an action epic set in feudal <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> in the 19th century in which he plays a Civil War hero schooling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japanese</ENAMEX> soldiers in modern warfare . 

Reports have been circulating in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Auckland</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cruise</ENAMEX> will take time away from the film set in the central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Island</ENAMEX> province of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taranaki</ENAMEX> to sail as 17th man aboard the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oracle</ENAMEX> race yacht when it begins the finals series Saturday against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Swiss</ENAMEX> entry <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alinghi</ENAMEX> . 

The 17th man is a traditional position on an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">America 's Cup</ENAMEX> yacht reserved for a guest of the owner . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cruise</ENAMEX> is a known acquaintance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oracle</ENAMEX> 's billionaire founder <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Ellison</ENAMEX> . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oracle</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Cahill</ENAMEX> said Friday he was aware of reports <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cruise</ENAMEX> had been invited to sail as 17th man during the best-of-nine finals series but knew of no invitation extended to the actor . 

`` I 've heard the story but as far as I know there 's not truth in it , '' he said .

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peru</ENAMEX> 's air force was searching for a plane carrying 46 passengers that disappeared while flying over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peru</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amazon</ENAMEX> jungle Thursday . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tans Airline</ENAMEX> flight 1396 was three minutes from landing at an airport of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chachapoyas</ENAMEX> , a city located in jungle-covered mountains 400 miles -LRB- 645 kilometers -RRB- north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lima</ENAMEX> , when radio contact was lost with the plane , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tans</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jorge Belevan</ENAMEX> said . 

`` That is when we lost contact with the plane , and we do n't have more information , '' he said . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Belevan</ENAMEX> said the air force was searching for the plane , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fokker</ENAMEX> 28 . 

He said it had sufficient fuel and may have landed at an alternative airport . 

He said flying conditions were good but that the weather in the jungle could change abruptly . 

The plane was flying from the coastal city of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chiclayo</ENAMEX> , 410 miles -LRB- 660 kilometers -RRB- northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lima</ENAMEX> , he said . 

Congressman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Alejos</ENAMEX> said he had been told by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aurelio Loret de Mola</ENAMEX> that military helicopters had joined the search . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chachapoyas</ENAMEX> is close to ancient <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indian</ENAMEX> ruins and is visited by foreign tourists . 

But no information was available on the identity or nationality of the plane 's passengers . 

Second -seeded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Meghann Shaughnessy</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> will meet fifth-seeded <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francesca Schiavone</ENAMEX> in Saturday 's final of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Canberra Classic</ENAMEX> women 's tennis tournament .

Drugmaker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schering - Plough Corp.</ENAMEX> lowered its earnings forecast for 2002 , citing a rapid decline in prescriptions for Claritin , its popular allergy drug . 

The pharmaceutical maker said it expected fourth-quarter earnings per share to come in at 27 cents to 29 cents , giving it a profit for the year of $ 1.40 to $ 1.42 per share . 

Analysts surveyed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Thomson First Call</ENAMEX> had forecast full-year 2002 earnings of $ 1.57 and fourth-quarter earnings of 44 cents . 

The company blamed the disappointing results on a sharp sales drop for Claritin , which became available without a prescription last month . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schering - Plough</ENAMEX> said prescription demand for the drug had fallen even more than it had anticipated . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schering - Plough</ENAMEX> initially fought the health insurance industry 's push to switch the drug to over-the-counter . 

Claritin accounts for one-third of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenilworth</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.J.</ENAMEX> -based company 's roughly $ 9 billion in annual revenues . 

Faced with expiration of Claritin 's main patent and the prospect of both generic and nonprescription competition , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schering - Plough</ENAMEX> backed down . 

The company also affirmed its 2003 earnings forecast of $ 1 to $ 1.15 per share . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Schering - Plough</ENAMEX> shares rose 19 cents to close at $ 23.06 Thursday on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> . 

The earnings news was released after the market closed , and company shares plunged $ 1.31 , or 5.6 percent , in extended trading . 

Gov. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Ryan</ENAMEX> 's decision to deliver speeches at two law schools that have been at the center of the fight against capital punishment has raised expectations that he will announce more clemencies before his term ends Monday . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ryan</ENAMEX> speaks at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DePaul University</ENAMEX> on Friday and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwestern University</ENAMEX> on Saturday . 

The addresses are widely expected to cap <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ryan</ENAMEX> 's three-year campaign to highlight flaws in the state 's death penalty system , which began when he declared a moratorium on executions in January 2000 . 

`` I do n't think he would come and give a speech that was going to greatly disappoint us , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rob Warden</ENAMEX> , executive director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwestern University Center on Wrongful Convictions</ENAMEX> . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ryan</ENAMEX> , a Republican , has said he will announce by the end of his term whether he will grant clemency to any or all of the state 's 160 death row inmates . 

He leaves office at noon Monday . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ryan</ENAMEX> 's suggestion last year that he might grant blanket clemency to every death row inmate prompted nearly all of them to seek mercy . 

That led to a controversial series of hearings in the fall that replayed some of the state 's most gruesome murders . 

After the hearings , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ryan</ENAMEX> said he was no longer inclined to grant blanket clemency . 

He has been under relentless pressure ever since from people on both sides of the issue -- families of inmates and crime victims , law professors , prosecutors and politicians . 

In recent weeks , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ryan</ENAMEX> has returned to anti-death penalty activism , twice announcing pardons of wrongfully convicted people who were no longer in jail . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DePaul University</ENAMEX> is home to an anti-death penalty center , while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Northwestern</ENAMEX> has spearheaded the anti-death penalty movement in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> . 

Scholars at its law school have fought on behalf of inmates , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwestern</ENAMEX> journalism students conducted investigations that freed death row convicts . 

Even as a corruption scandal plagued his administration , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ryan</ENAMEX> , who did not seek re-election , could always count on a warm welcome at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwestern</ENAMEX> . 

Increasing the optimism of death penalty opponents is the invitation extended by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ryan</ENAMEX> to relatives of death row inmates to one or both of the speeches . 

`` The governor 's office invited me to the speech -LRB- Friday -RRB- and they 're giving me a special seat , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Costella Cannon</ENAMEX> , the mother of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Bounds</ENAMEX> , who died of a heart attack in 1998 while on death row . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guatemalan</ENAMEX> twins born joined at the skull will return home to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guatemala</ENAMEX> next week , five months after the girls were successfully separated in a marathon surgery , a hospital spokeswoman announced Thursday . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria Teresa Quiej Alvarez</ENAMEX> and her sister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria de Jesus</ENAMEX> are slated to leave Monday morning on a five-hour flight to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guatemala City</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elaine Schmidt</ENAMEX> , spokeswoman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mattel Children 's Hospital</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of California at Los Angeles</ENAMEX> . 

The 17-month -old girls were separated Aug. 6 in a 23-hour surgery . 

At first , their return home was delayed to give them time to recover from follow-up surgeries . 

It was delayed again at the request of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Guatemalan</ENAMEX> health authorities who needed more time to prepare for their arrival , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schmidt</ENAMEX> said . 

Once home , the two face additional surgeries to gradually stretch their scalps to eliminate the skin grafts and allow them to grow full heads of hair .

A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peruvian</ENAMEX> airliner carrying 46 people , including eight children , disappeared amid cloud-covered mountains in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amazon</ENAMEX> jungle . 

Heavy rain hampered the search effort . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peru</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">air force</ENAMEX> halted helicopter missions to find the plane late in the afternoon , and weather forecasts called for more rain Friday . 

`` The air search has been suspended due to rain . 

We are focusing on organizing ground teams to send out , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Avelino Flores</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Civil Defense</ENAMEX> official in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Luyo</ENAMEX> , the village closest to the area where the plane was believed to have gone down . 

The area was at least six hours away by foot , over difficult terrain . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TANS Airline</ENAMEX> flight 222 was about three minutes from landing at an airport in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chachapoyas</ENAMEX> , a city in the jungle-covered mountains 400 miles -LRB- 645 kilometers -RRB- north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lima</ENAMEX> , when radio contact was lost , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jorge Belevan</ENAMEX> , chief spokesman for the state-owned airline . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Belevan</ENAMEX> said there were four crew and 42 passengers aboard the plane , including eight children , and a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgian</ENAMEX> husband and wife identified as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christophe Dubois</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sofia Porfirio</ENAMEX> . 

`` We still do n't know if the plane made an emergency landing because it is prepared for that type of emergency , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lizandro Toro</ENAMEX> , another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TANS</ENAMEX> spokesman . 

But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Elio</ENAMEX> , president of an association of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peruvian</ENAMEX> pilots , said an emergency landing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chachapoyas</ENAMEX> area was virtually impossible because of the mountainous terrain . 

In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgium</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foreign Affairs</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Didier Seeuws</ENAMEX> said the passengers included a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgian</ENAMEX> who had lived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peru</ENAMEX> for years and was married a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peruvian</ENAMEX> . 

He had no other information . 

`` It is still unclear , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Seeuws</ENAMEX> said . 

`` Even our embassy in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lima</ENAMEX> does n't know at the moment . '' 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Elio</ENAMEX> , president of an association of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peruvian</ENAMEX> pilots , said an emergency landing in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chachapoyas</ENAMEX> area was virtually impossible because of the mountainous terrain . 

The plane , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fokker</ENAMEX> 28 , was rented from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peru</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">air force</ENAMEX> and was built in 1965 . 

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fokker</ENAMEX> 28 is a twin-engine turbo jet that can carry as many as 62 passengers . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Belevan</ENAMEX> initially said that flying conditions were good Thursday morning but noted that the weather in the jungle can change quickly . 

Meteorologist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abraham Levy</ENAMEX> said it was not raining but low-hanging clouds draped the mountains near <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chachapoyas</ENAMEX> at the time the plane was to land . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TANS</ENAMEX> was set up 40 years ago to fly to remote jungle towns that private airlines did not service because the routes were not profitable . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chachapoyas</ENAMEX> is close to ancient Indian ruins and is visited by foreign tourists . 

Five <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> students asked a court Thursday to declare unconstitutional a federal law that requires 18-year -old men , but not women , to register for military service . 

Their suit claims the law amounts to gender -based discrimination and violates their civil rights . 

The military draft ended in 1973 . 

But in 1980 , a requirement for 18-year -old men to register with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Selective Service System</ENAMEX> was revived . 

Men who do not register cannot receive federal student aid or hold certain federal jobs and are subject to criminal prosecution . 

More than 30 states link registration to certain benefits such as tuition assistance . 

Plaintiff <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicole Foley</ENAMEX> , 17 , said she suspects the law has not been changed to include women because of long-standing attitudes about women in the military . 

`` It 's so ingrained in our society that this is the way it is -- that boys , when there 's a war , go off to war , and the girls wait home and get the letters , '' she said . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Foley</ENAMEX> 's brother , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Schwartz</ENAMEX> , 18 , and three friends are the other plaintiffs . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schwartz</ENAMEX> said he reluctantly registered about six months ago . 

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> upheld the law in 1981 , citing combat restrictions then in effect for women . 

But the siblings ' father , civil rights lawyer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvey Schwartz</ENAMEX> , said times have changed and so should the law . 

`` Women can now do just about anything men can do in the military , with some limited exceptions , '' he said . 

`` It 's time for the courts and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to take another look at this . '' 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alyce Burton</ENAMEX> , a spokeswoman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Selective Service System</ENAMEX> , would not comment on the suit . 

But she said the men-only registration requirement is part of the current law . 

`` For women to register , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> would have to change the law , '' she said . 

The Military Selective Service Act requires all men to register within 30 days of their 18th birthday . 

From 1948 to 1973 , the military draft was used to bolster the armed forces during periods of both war and peace . 

Even though there has not been a draft since 1973 , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Selective Service</ENAMEX> system was kept in place in case an emergency made it necessary for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to again authorize inductions . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Registration for Selective Service</ENAMEX> was suspended in 1975 , at the end of the Vietnam War , but former President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy Carter</ENAMEX> reinstated the requirement in 1980 in response to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Soviet</ENAMEX> invasion of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> . 

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sacramento Kings</ENAMEX> went on a 38-10 run bridging the first and second quarters , and eventually led by as many as 42 points , in defeating <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> 118-82 Thursday It was the first home loss for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nets</ENAMEX> since Nov. 16 , when the West 's other powerhouse -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dallas Mavericks</ENAMEX> -- beat them by eight points . 

That game at least was competitive , a quality this game lacked for a majority of its 48 minutes . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peja Stojakovic</ENAMEX> scored 24 points , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Bibby</ENAMEX> added 23 , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris Webber</ENAMEX> had 19 points and 11 rebounds for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kings</ENAMEX> , who won their fourth successive game <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lucious Harris</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jason Collins</ENAMEX> scored 11 points each for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nets</ENAMEX> , whose home winning streak was snapped at 13 games .

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Smoak</ENAMEX> 's dog , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patton</ENAMEX> , was a 16th birthday gift for his stepson . 

Now , the mixed breed pit bull and boxer is buried in his yard , a reminder of a vacation that turned tragic when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX> authorities mistakenly pulled over the family , then fatally shot the dog after he bounded out of the car wagging its tail . 

`` I want them punished , '' he said Thursday in a telephone interview from his home in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saluda</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">N.C.</ENAMEX> `` I do n't ever want to see this happen to anybody else . '' 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smoak</ENAMEX> , a seafood salesman , says he has spoken with several attorneys and plans legal action . 

It happened on New Year 's Day when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX> state troopers and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cookeville</ENAMEX> police stopped the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smoaks</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Interstate 40</ENAMEX> as they returned from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nashville</ENAMEX> . 

Authorities said they thought the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smoaks</ENAMEX> ' station wagon might be connected to a robbery . 

A patrol car videotape shows <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cookeville</ENAMEX> police officer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Hall</ENAMEX> shot the dog as it jumped from the car and ran toward him . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> contends he had no choice when the animal charged him . 

He has been reassigned to administrative duties pending an independent review . 

A police investigation found that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> did not use excessive force . 

Both agencies have apologized , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smoak</ENAMEX> says the regrets ring hollow because they came only after the incident received media attention . 

`` At the scene they told us they made a mistake and that we were free to go , '' he said . 

`` No one was moved to say they were sorry . '' 

A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British</ENAMEX> king 's statue might be pulled down and placed among the monkeys in a zoo to make room for the likeness of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chinese</ENAMEX> hero , and Her Majesty 's government seems less than amused . 

`` It does seem a pity , '' the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British</ENAMEX> Consulate said Friday . 

Some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> district councilors want to remove King <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX> VI from a prime perch in a downtown botanical and zoological park and replace him with Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun Yat -sen</ENAMEX> , the revolutionary recognized as the father of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX> , whose daughter Queen <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth II</ENAMEX> is now on the throne , would end up in the area of the park 's monkey enclosure . 

`` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun Yat -sen</ENAMEX> is more important than King <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX> VI -- this is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chinese</ENAMEX> soil , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Chor -nam</ENAMEX> , chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western District Council</ENAMEX> . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British</ENAMEX> diplomats said it was <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> 's call on whether to move the statue -- more than five years after this former colony was returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chinese</ENAMEX> sovereignty . 

`` That said , it seems a shame -- given that so much of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> 's past over the years has given way to new development , it does seem a pity to move it needlessly , '' consular spokeswoman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rebecca Merrett</ENAMEX> said by telephone . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX> , who reigned between 1936-52 , became beloved among Britons for staying in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> while it was bombed by the Germans during the Blitz in World War II . 

The proposal to replace <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun</ENAMEX> stirred a heated debate Thursday evening in a district council meeting and captured a fair amount of media attention Friday . 

`` Monarch may move next to monkeys , '' read a headline the English -language <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">South China Morning Post</ENAMEX> . 

A cartoon showed two monkeys grumbling that placing the king in their midst seemed disrespectful , given `` the way them royals have been behaving lately . '' 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun</ENAMEX> founded the first <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chinese</ENAMEX> republic early in the last century and no one is arguing against honoring him , but some councilors said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> 's history as a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British</ENAMEX> colony should not be erased and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George</ENAMEX> should stay in place . 

`` We should not glorify our colonial legacy , but the statue is part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> history , '' District Councilor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kam Nai -wai</ENAMEX> said Thursday . 

`` It brings back many memories . '' 

A plaque on the statue refers to `` His Most Gracious Majesty King <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George VI</ENAMEX> , '' saying it was erected to commemorate the centennial in 1941 of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> 's founding as a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British</ENAMEX> colony . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> has for some time been planning a memorial garden to honor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun</ENAMEX> , but the project has been hit by delays and there has been no decision on an appropriately high-profile place to put up a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sun</ENAMEX> statue . 

After <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> handed <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> on July 1 , 1997 , some vestiges of the colonial past soon vanished . 

In one often-cited example , a waterfront skyscraper formerly called the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prince of Wales</ENAMEX> building was turned into an army barracks and renamed the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Chinese People 's Liberation Army Forces Hong Kong Building</ENAMEX> . 

A judge 's jaw dropped and a witness covered his eyes Thursday as they watched the videotape that four men are accused of making by inducing the homeless to brawl in exchange for beer , doughnuts and money . 

The defendants pleaded innocent Thursday to charges of battery , illegal fight promotion , conspiracy and soliciting an assault with deadly force . 

The witness , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Laforte</ENAMEX> , said the filmmakers paid a homeless woman $ 20 to attack him in a public restroom in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Diego</ENAMEX> in 2001 . 

`` She said they would pay her money to fight someone ; she was hungry ; she needed money to eat , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laforte</ENAMEX> testified in the first day of a preliminary hearing . 

The explosive brawl that ensued is the first scene on the videotape , `` Bumfights : A Cause for Concern , '' which was sold over the Internet for $ 20 a copy . 

Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lannie Brainard</ENAMEX> watched openmouthed as scenes from the tape were played . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laforte</ENAMEX> covered his eyes , saying he was ashamed he hit the woman several times in the face . 

The video , promoted by radio shock jock <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Stern</ENAMEX> and denounced on the floor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Representatives</ENAMEX> , has sold about 300,000 copies , police said . 

Two homeless men shown fighting each other in the videotape , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Brennan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rufus Hannah</ENAMEX> , are suing the filmmakers for assault and battery , intentional infliction of emotional distress and civil rights violations . 

The defendants are <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ryan McPherson</ENAMEX> , 19 ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zachary Bubeck</ENAMEX> , 25 ; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel J. Tanner</ENAMEX> , 21 ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Slyman</ENAMEX> , 21 . 

Security guards , highway patrol officers and sheriff 's deputies converged on a 400-year -old oak tree Thursday to pressure an environmentalist living in its branches to leave . 

Authorities served <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Quigley</ENAMEX> -- who is trying to save the tree from a developer 's road-widening plan -- with a trespassing lawsuit and removed his tent and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">American</ENAMEX> flag . 

A roadblock was set up near the tree and a fence and `` No Trespassing '' signs were erected to keep away <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quigley</ENAMEX> 's fellow protesters . 

Several people sleeping under the tree were ordered to leave . 

`` This is ridiculous , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quigley</ENAMEX> said . 

`` Talk about overkill ... 

They could have called and we could have talked about it . '' 

The tree , dubbed `` Old Glory '' is located in a ravine next to a neighborhood of recently built homes . 

The oak stands in the way of a road widening project that would serve the proposed 21,600-home <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Newhall Ranch</ENAMEX> development north of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quigley</ENAMEX> , 42 , had been scheduled to be replaced in the oak by another activist Thursday but now intends to remain in the tree to protect it . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Rattazzi</ENAMEX> , president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> division of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John Laing Homes</ENAMEX> , said no attempt was made to remove or arrest <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quigley</ENAMEX> . 

`` These actions were taken to stabilize the situation and allow the issue to be decided in the courts in an orderly manner , '' he said . 

Activists have refused to end their protest despite a proposal by the developer to relocate the tree to a nearby park . 

Environmentalists fear the oak would not survive the move . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Furyk</ENAMEX> felt right at home Thursday in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercedes</ENAMEX> Championships , where he polished off a 9-under 64 just 300 yards -LRB- meters -RRB- from his house and wound up in a share of the lead with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernie Els</ENAMEX> . 

Only three players in the 36-man field of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGA</ENAMEX> Tour winners were over par . 

More than half of the field were in the 60s , and the average score -- 69.31 -- was the lowest for any round in the five years that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercedes</ENAMEX> has been played at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kapalua</ENAMEX> . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Furyk</ENAMEX> played 27 holes on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Plantation Course</ENAMEX> just two months ago , and he 's the only person on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGA</ENAMEX> Tour to have played in the season-opening <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercedes</ENAMEX> all five years since it moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kapalua</ENAMEX> . 

`` I know the course plenty well , whether I play here in the offseason or not , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Furyk</ENAMEX> said of his home-field advantage . 

He attributed his bogey-free 64 to an eagle on the par-5 ninth that kept him in the lead most of the day , and a great round of putting , including a 40-footer he made on the 17th hole . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Els</ENAMEX> also feels at home at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kapalua</ENAMEX> , one of his favorite stops . 

He missed last year after failing to win on the tour for the first since 1994 , but victories at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Doral</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British</ENAMEX> Open brought him back . 

And the Big Easy looks intent on returning a lot more often . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Els</ENAMEX> made two eagles in surprisingly gentle conditions , and played the final seven holes in 6-under par to match <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Furyk</ENAMEX> at 64 . 

He had a chance to take the outright lead after hitting a 2-iron to within 5.5 meters -LRB- 18 feet -RRB- , but his eagle putt came up short . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris Riley</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Sauers</ENAMEX> each had a 65 , two players more representative of this year 's 36-man field at the winners-only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercedes</ENAMEX> . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tiger Woods</ENAMEX> is not playing this year because of knee surgery last month , while second-ranked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Mickelson</ENAMEX> is taking time off . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Toms</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis Love III</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Duval</ENAMEX> did n't win last year , so they did n't qualify . 

In their place are guys like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Riley</ENAMEX> , who is among the 18 players who won for the first time on tour last year , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sauers</ENAMEX> , who went 13 years between victories . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Kelly</ENAMEX> , who won his first <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGA Tour</ENAMEX> event at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sony</ENAMEX> Open in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Honolulu</ENAMEX> , also had a 65 . 

Rookie -of-the-year <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Byrd</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luke Donald</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">England</ENAMEX> were in the group at 68 . 

It was a spectacular start to the season in more ways than one -- plenty of sunshine and only a trace of wind . 

`` I do n't think I 've ever seen it this calm , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Els</ENAMEX> said . 

`` When you get a day like today , you 've got to take advantage . '' 

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PGA</ENAMEX> champion <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rich Beem</ENAMEX> -LRB- 74 -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Spain</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose Maria Olazabal</ENAMEX> -LRB- 74 -RRB- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Len Mattiace</ENAMEX> -LRB- 75 -RRB- were the only players who failed to shoot par or better on what figures to be the easiest day of the tournament . 

`` I told my caddie , ` We 'd better get going early because I do n't know if we 'll have another day like this , ' '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Els</ENAMEX> said . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Els</ENAMEX> did n't carry out his plan to perfection . 

A tap-in birdie on the 436-meter -LRB- 484-yard -RRB- seventh hole pushed him to 4 under for the round , only that did n't last long . 

He tried to fade a 6-iron to the flag on the par-3 eighth , but he held onto the club too long , and the ball went down the hill left into the hazard . 

It was similar to the mistake he made at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Muirfield</ENAMEX> on the 16th , which also led to a double bogey and nearly cost him the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British</ENAMEX> Open . 

Just like then , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Els</ENAMEX> recovered . 

He birdied the next hole , then really turned it loose on the back nine , belting his driver with confidence and setting up short birdie putts . 

He hit 7-iron for his second shot on the 500-meter -LRB- 555-yard -RRB- 15th hole to within 4.5 meters -LRB- 15 feet -RRB- for his second eagle of the round . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Els</ENAMEX> is due a victory at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kapalua</ENAMEX> . 

He had a chance three years ago against <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woods</ENAMEX> , when both eagled the 18th , birdied the 18th in a playoff and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woods</ENAMEX> finally won with a 13 meter -LRB- 40-foot -RRB- birdie on the second playoff hole . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Els</ENAMEX> also had control in 2001 , but instead watched <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Furyk</ENAMEX> -- his playing partner in the final round -- hole critical putts to win . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Woods</ENAMEX> is n't around this year , out for at least the first five weeks of the season while recovering from knee surgery . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Els</ENAMEX> will play Friday with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Furyk</ENAMEX> , who can be just as tough on a course <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Furyk</ENAMEX> has come to love . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Furyk</ENAMEX> won at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kapalua</ENAMEX> during the silly-season in 1995 , and he has never finished lower than ninth in five years at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercedes</ENAMEX> . 

He wasted no time moving to the top this year , hitting a 4-wood off the tee at No. 9 and another 4-wood to within 4.5 meters -LRB- 15 feet -RRB- for an eagle . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Furyk</ENAMEX> made five other putts of at least 4.5 meters -LRB- 15 feet -RRB- , including the 13-meter -LRB- 40-foot -RRB- shot on No . 

17 . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Furyk</ENAMEX> knows <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Kapalua</ENAMEX> well enough to realize there wo n't be too many days easier than this one for low scoring . 

`` About as good as it gets , '' he said . 

`` The wind laid down for us today , made it possible to go out there and shoot low scores . '' 

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> demanded Friday <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> reverse its decision to quit the global nuclear arms control treaty and respond positively to end fears about its suspected nuclear weapons program . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> announced it had withdrawn from the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty . 

It blamed what it said was <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> aggression toward it , but said it would not develop nuclear weapons `` at this stage . '' 

`` Our nation will strongly demand from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> a quick retraction of its statement and a positive response to solving the nuclear weapons problem , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japanese</ENAMEX> Chief <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cabinet</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yasuo Fukuda</ENAMEX> said in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tokyo</ENAMEX> . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fukuda</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> will work closely with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea</ENAMEX> and other nations as well as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Atomic Energy Agency</ENAMEX> to address the crisis . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea</ENAMEX> , which has repeatedly called for diplomacy to ease tension , had no immediate response to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pyongyang</ENAMEX> 's decision . 

Before the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North</ENAMEX> 's announcement on Friday , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea</ENAMEX> 's president-elect <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roh Moo -hyun</ENAMEX> warned of the dangers of punishing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pyongyang</ENAMEX> over its nuclear weapons program . 

`` Once we start using the stick , it 's difficult to change course , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roh</ENAMEX> , who will take office on Feb. 25 , said Thursday . 

`` The carrot may cost a lot and may not easily attract popular support , but it will be cheaper than creating dangerous situations . '' 

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX> does not plan to review its nuclear-free policy , the foreign minister said Friday , although it is widely seen as an obstacle to securing a free-trade pact with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Goff</ENAMEX> ruled out any change in the policy , which was instituted in 1984 and bans nuclear weapons and nuclear-powered ships from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX> territory , or even a policy review , which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> officials have suggested . 

The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> wants the policy overturned so its warships and submarines can visit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX> ports . 

`` We 've got no plans to review it , or particular cause to review it , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goff</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Associated Press</ENAMEX> . 

The policy would only be reviewed `` if we feel the need to change it ... and nobody has given a pressing reason why we should bring nuclear powered ships into the harbor , '' he said . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> Trade Representative <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Zoellick</ENAMEX> is due to put a proposal to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> shortly seeking approval to open negotiations with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX> on a free trade deal , which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wellington</ENAMEX> is eager for . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goff</ENAMEX> said the nuclear-free policy was not a major obstacle to a free trade agreement , although <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> would include it in negotiations . 

It was not a `` key issue on which a free trade agreement moves forward or does n't move forward , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goff</ENAMEX> said . 

More important was the issue of access for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX> agricultural products to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> market , he said . 

Recently a leading opposition lawmaker broke ranks with the opposition <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Party</ENAMEX> by calling for the ban on nuclear-powered ships to be scrapped . 

The party 's policy has previously mirrored the government 's stance . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goff</ENAMEX> said even a review of the policy would raise `` unreasonable expectations of change , '' as happened when the 1991 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Party</ENAMEX> government carried out a review and left the policy unchanged . 

`` That led to the Americans feeling duped ... publicly let down and embarrassed , '' he added . 

`` It 's better to be frank and better to be honest . '' 

The most recent public opinion poll reported that 65 percent of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealanders</ENAMEX> oppose nuclear ship visits . 

Late last year , Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helen Clark</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX> had constructed its foreign policy around `` being a small independent minded country that takes these issues seriously ... and I am not about to throw it all away -LRB- for a trade deal -RRB- . '' 

After the anti-nuclear law was adopted in 1984 , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> ejected <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Zealand</ENAMEX> from a three-way military alliance , known as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ANZUS</ENAMEX> . 

A police investigator testified Thursday that a man was not coerced into confessing to taking part in the killing of a newborn , an account challenged by lawyers who say the man is mentally retarded and the infant never existed . 

Defense witnesses said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Medell Banks</ENAMEX> has an IQ of 57 and probably would not have understood his rights when they were read to him before he made incriminating statements in 1999 . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Circuit</ENAMEX> Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Butler</ENAMEX> is to decide if the statements should be allowed as evidence in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Banks</ENAMEX> ' capital murder trial , set to begin Monday . 

The hearing was to resume Friday . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Banks</ENAMEX> , his estranged wife , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victoria Banks</ENAMEX> , and her sister , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dianne Tucker</ENAMEX> , pleaded guilty to manslaughter and received 15-year sentences after being charged with capital murder in the death of the infant , supposedly born to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victoria Banks</ENAMEX> . 

Defense lawyers , however , have argued that all three are mentally retarded and were intimidated into pleas . 

They introduced testimony from a gynecologist that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Banks</ENAMEX> ' wife was sterile from a surgical procedure and could not have been pregnant . 

After a number of news stories about the case , including a series by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Associated Press</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tucker</ENAMEX> was released from prison with a reduced sentence and an appeals court ruled that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Banks</ENAMEX> could withdraw his plea . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Banks</ENAMEX> ' wife , in prison on an unrelated conviction , did not seek to change her plea . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alabama Bureau of Investigation</ENAMEX> agent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stan Stabler</ENAMEX> testified Thursday he advised <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banks</ENAMEX> in 1999 of his rights to remain silent and have a lawyer . 

He said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Banks</ENAMEX> was not coerced into saying he took part in the newborn 's death and buried the infant 's body . 

No evidence of the baby or a burial site was ever found . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joyce Dixon</ENAMEX> -- who taught <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Banks</ENAMEX> in high school , where he was a special education student -- testified that he was a slow learner . 

`` You would have to repeat things to him quite frequently , '' she said . 

Mental health expert <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Siders</ENAMEX> , a professor at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Southern Mississippi</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hattiesburg</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Banks</ENAMEX> has an IQ of 57 , which he said signals mild retardation . 

In a bid to revitalize the economy by the time she steps down in 2004 , President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gloria Macapagal Arroyo</ENAMEX> signed into law Friday two key bills aimed at stemming official corruption and freeing banks of bad loans . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arroyo</ENAMEX> said last month she wo n't run for presidency and would use her remaining months in office to push the economy forward . 

On Friday she said she would focus on creating more jobs and curbing graft and bureaucratic red tape . 

To symbolize the importance of the two measures to the economy , she signed the bills in a ceremony at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philippine Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> headquarters . 

One of the laws , the Special Purpose Vehicle Act , will enable banks to convert idle assets into cash to release badly needed funds . 

`` The SPAV seeks to save the banking sector from the financial fallout of lending decisions that went sour after the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Asian</ENAMEX> crisis -LRB- of 1997-98 -RRB- , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arroyo</ENAMEX> said , adding the banks have been groaning under more than 300 billion pesos -LRB- US$ 5.6 billion -RRB- in bad loans and 200 billion pesos -LRB- US$ 3.7 billion -RRB- in repossessed assets . 

The Government Procurement Reform Act aims at eliminating corruption in the state procurement contracts , the hiring of consultants and the award of infrastructure projects , which drain an estimated 22 billion pesos -LRB- US$ 415 million -RRB- from public coffers every year . 

`` As a bonus , the money that can be saved by making more procurement more effective , efficient and less prone to corrupt practices will reduce the budget deficit , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arroyo</ENAMEX> said . 

She promised the government will wage `` an unrelenting war '' against business fraud and official extortion . 

`` If anyone in my government tries it , tell me , '' she said . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arroyo</ENAMEX> , 55 , took office in January 2001 after mass protests forced her predecessor , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Estrada</ENAMEX> , to flee the presidential palace amid corruption charges . 

Her term has been beset by crises over Muslim separatists , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">communist</ENAMEX> rebels , crime and turbulent politics . 

The economy was the most daunting challenge facing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arroyo</ENAMEX> when she was sworn in : 40 percent of the country 's population of 76 million were living below the poverty line , and unemployment was above 11 percent . 

The national debt was a record US$ 3.5 billion in the first 10 months of last year . 

The government blames the debt in part on inefficient and corrupt tax collectors . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arroyo</ENAMEX> has said that not running for election in 2004 will give her a free hand to revamp the economy instead of campaigning . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arroyo</ENAMEX> also announced several infrastructure projects and asked <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to pass into law reform measures to improve productivity , tax collection and encourage investments . 

A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chinese</ENAMEX> court is to hear appeals from two Tibetans whose convictions in a series of bombings prompted an international outcry , a court official said Friday . 

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sichuan Provincial High People 's Court</ENAMEX> will review a death sentence imposed last month on one of the men , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lobsang Dhondup</ENAMEX> , said a court official who refused to give his name . 

The hearing was to take place later Friday in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ganzi</ENAMEX> , the city in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sichuan</ENAMEX> province where two bombings in 2001 killed one person and injured another . 

The area is near the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tibetan</ENAMEX> border and has a large ethnic <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tibetan</ENAMEX> population . 

A third bombing went off last April in a park in the provincial capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chengdu</ENAMEX> . 

The court will also hear the appeal of the second person convicted , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tibetan</ENAMEX> Buddhist leader who received a suspended death sentence , according to the court official . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> says the two confessed . 

But activists say they were mistreated in custody and did not receive a fair trial . 

Their cases were raised last month during a visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> 's top human rights official , Assistant Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorne Craner</ENAMEX> . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> has angrily rejected such appeals as interference in its affairs , but it occasionally releases political prisoners following foreign pressure . 

Activists accuse <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> of misusing the global antiterror campaign as an excuse to crush peaceful pro-independence sentiment in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tibet</ENAMEX> and the northwestern Muslim region of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Xinjiang</ENAMEX> . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist</ENAMEX> troops marched into the region in 1950 , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> says it has been part of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> for centuries . 

The exiled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tibetan</ENAMEX> leader , the Dalai Lama , has urged Tibetans to avoid violence . 

But militants opposed to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chinese</ENAMEX> rule have carried out at several bomb attacks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Himalayan</ENAMEX> region since the mid-1990s . 

The court official in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sichuan</ENAMEX> refused to give additional details of the hearing . 

The human rights group <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amnesty International</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche</ENAMEX> , 52 , has been hung from the ceiling by shackles on his hands and feet . 

It said he is on a hunger strike in protest . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche</ENAMEX> is an influential leader of Tibetans in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sichuan</ENAMEX> . 

He studied in the 1980s with the Dalai Lama , the exiled <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tibetan</ENAMEX> spiritual leader , according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> -based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tibet Information Network</ENAMEX> . 

Death sentences in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> are usually carried out , while suspended death sentences often are commuted to long prison terms . 

Student editors at a high school newspaper filed a lawsuit Thursday accusing their school district of violating their First Amendment rights by confiscating an edition that contained an article about student drinking . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. District Court</ENAMEX> Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Nugent</ENAMEX> turned down a request from the four <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wooster High School</ENAMEX> students for a temporary restraining order that would have prevented the district from blocking distribution . 

Last month , the district confiscated 4,500 copies of the biweekly paper on the advice of lawyers who said the publication contained inaccuracies and was potentially libelous . 

Student editors said the copies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Wooster Blade</ENAMEX> were seized because the newspaper contained a story saying athletes and the daughter of a school board member consumed alcohol at a party in November . 

The school district and the students reached a deal Thursday that allows the paper to be distributed on condition portions the district finds objectionable be deleted , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Myers</ENAMEX> , a lawyer for the students . 

`` We 're still going to fight for the right to publish it as is , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Myers</ENAMEX> said . 

The editors ' lawsuit requests damages and asks the court to prevent the district from carrying out discipline against them . 

The school 's principal , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Jackson</ENAMEX> , said a teacher told him about a possible confidentiality problem related to a story about the party . 

At least two students said they were misquoted in statements that `` attributed to them acts of misconduct and potentially acts of criminal behavior , '' school Superintendent <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Estrop</ENAMEX> said .

Opponents of President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugo Chavez</ENAMEX> accused the embattled leader of promoting political violence after opposition-led marches in several cities were attacked by radical government supporters . 

`` It 's the leader of the country who is provoking this violence , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Ortega</ENAMEX> , president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confederation of Venezuelan Workers</ENAMEX> , the nation 's largest and most powerful trade union . 

`` If we live in democracy , why do n't you allow the public to march peacefully ? '' added <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ortega</ENAMEX> . 

Government supporters attacked anti- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chavez</ENAMEX> marchers in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caracas</ENAMEX> and outside oil facilities around the country , the latest incidents of political violence in this crisis-stricken <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South American</ENAMEX> country of 24 million . 

`` Chavistas , '' as the president 's backers are called , attacked a rally outside a refinery in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cardon</ENAMEX> , 270 miles -LRB- 434 kilometers -RRB- east of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caracas</ENAMEX> , wounding a 40-year -old worker and a 28-year -old demonstrator , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luis Arends</ENAMEX> , a civil defense worker . 

In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caracas</ENAMEX> , gunmen fired several shots and threw tear gas at an opposition rally . 

No one was hurt , and the rally resumed . 

There were no arrests . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chavez</ENAMEX> supporters armed with machetes and sticks also prevented a demonstration at an oil facility in central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Carabobo</ENAMEX> state , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Globovision</ENAMEX> television reported . 

A minor clash occurred at a plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Barinas</ENAMEX> state . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chavez</ENAMEX> , a leftist former paratroop commander who was elected in 1998 and re-elected two years later , denies he is fomenting escalating violence . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chavez</ENAMEX> opponents claim the president 's fiery rhetoric incites violent reactions from his most radical backers . 

In January 2002 , four supporters of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chavez</ENAMEX> 's ruling party were slain in western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zulia</ENAMEX> state . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nineteen</ENAMEX> died last year on April 11 , when rival marches clashed in downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Caracas</ENAMEX> . 

The bloodshed spurred a coup and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chavez</ENAMEX> 's brief ouster . 

Loyalists in the military returned him to power on April 14 . 

Three more citizens were killed , presumably by a lone gunman , at an opposition rallying point on Nov. 6 , and two government supporters died of gunshot wounds at a street march last Friday . 

Thursday 's aggressions occurred as thousands of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venezuelan</ENAMEX> bank workers stayed home to support a nationwide strike seeking new presidential elections , further weakening the currency as analysts speculate that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chavez</ENAMEX> 's government is running out of money . 

The nationwide strike that began Dec. 2 has shut thousands of businesses and brought <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venezuela</ENAMEX> 's vital oil industry -- once the world 's fifth-largest exporter -- to a virtual halt . 

Gas has been imported . 

Amid fears of a banking crisis , Venezuelans bought <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> dollars and sent the bolivar currency to a record low of 1,593 to the dollar -- 5 percent weaker than Wednesday and down 12 percent for the year . 

Analysts speculated <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chavez</ENAMEX> 's government may have to devalue the bolivar to balance its budget . 

Most government income is in dollars and a weaker bolivar would increase its domestic spending power . 

Spokesmen at three of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venezuela</ENAMEX> 's largest banks -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banco de Venezuela</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banco Provincial</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Banesco</ENAMEX> -- said 80 percent of the country 's nearly 60,000 bank employees stayed home Thursday . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose Torres</ENAMEX> , president of the opposition-aligned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fetrabanca</ENAMEX> workers union , urged employees to provide only minimal services -- such as processing payments for medical emergencies -- Thursday and Friday . 

But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Luis Boris</ENAMEX> , secretary general of the pro-government bank workers union <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sutrabanca</ENAMEX> , accused bank owners of closing doors without consulting workers . 

A nonbinding referendum on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chavez</ENAMEX> 's rule is scheduled for Feb. 2 . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chavez</ENAMEX> insists the constitution only requires him to respect a possible recall referendum in August , the midpoint of his six-year term . 

Strike organizers -- including leaders of the nation 's largest trade union , its business chamber and the state-run oil company -- claim their protest is as strong as ever . 

Many factories , industrial parks and supermarkets remained closed . 

But there were signs many are tiring of the strike . 

There was more traffic on streets and sidewalks and in shops , restaurants and markets . 

Efforts by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chavez</ENAMEX> to jump-start operations at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDVSA</ENAMEX> , have been partially successful . 

Crude output is estimated at about 400,000 barrels a day , compared with the pre-strike level of 3 million barrels . 

Exports , normally 2.5 million barrels a day , are at 500,000 barrels a day . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy</ENAMEX> Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rafael Ramirez</ENAMEX> claimed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDVSA</ENAMEX> will produce 1.5 million barrels a day by next week and will reach full capacity next month . 

Dissident <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">PDVSA</ENAMEX> workers doubt production can reach those levels so soon . 

Some 350 former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gurkha</ENAMEX> soldiers who fought for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British</ENAMEX> during World War II are filing claims for compensation from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> for the time they spent as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japanese</ENAMEX> prisoners , their advocates said Friday . 

The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gurkha</ENAMEX> soldiers from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nepal</ENAMEX> are taking advantage of a November decision by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">High Court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> that said they have the right to seek compensation from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British</ENAMEX> government and be treated the same as other soldiers who fought for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British army</ENAMEX> . 

`` We are leaving for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> on Saturday with at least 350 claims from former prisoners of war or their widows to file them at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Ministry</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Padam Gurung</ENAMEX> , chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gurkha Army Ex - Servicemen 's Organization</ENAMEX> . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gurung</ENAMEX> 's organization has battled with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British</ENAMEX> government to end the different treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gurkha</ENAMEX> soldiers who are still serving or had served with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British army</ENAMEX> . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gurkhas</ENAMEX> began fighting for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> in 1815 in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> . 

With <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indian</ENAMEX> independence in 1947 they became part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British army</ENAMEX> . 

Nearly 3,600 serve now , and have taken part in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British</ENAMEX> operations in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bosnia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sierra Leone</ENAMEX> . 

In a fund the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British</ENAMEX> government set up in November 2000 for surviving <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British</ENAMEX> POWs from World War II , each former soldier was to receive 10,000 pounds -LRB- US$ 15,500 -RRB- . 

The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Ministry of Defense</ENAMEX> had argued that World War II Gurkha regiments formed part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indian</ENAMEX> army and were ineligible for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British army</ENAMEX> compensation . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> had claimed the two armies were subject to different codes of military law and regulations and were constitutionally separate , although <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British</ENAMEX> officers commanded the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indian</ENAMEX> army and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gurkha</ENAMEX> troops . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> also says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gurkha</ENAMEX> pensions are now roughly equivalent to one-third of the pensions for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British</ENAMEX> soldiers and are more than adequate for retirees in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nepal</ENAMEX> , one of the world 's poorest countries . 

Although the cost of living in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nepal</ENAMEX> is much lower than in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gurkhas</ENAMEX> argue that the pension is still far too low . 

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gurung</ENAMEX> said that a hearing on the pension case is coming up in February . 

`` We are confident that we will win this case , too , and that justice will be served for hundreds of former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Gurkha</ENAMEX> soldiers who risked their lives for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> but were denied a fair pension , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gopal Siwakoti</ENAMEX> , the former soldiers ' lawyer .
